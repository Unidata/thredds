# When text is set to "auto", the path is marked for automatic end-of-line conversion.
# If Git decides that the content is text, its line endings are converted to LF on
# checkin. When the file has been committed with CRLF, no conversion is done.

* text=auto

# Override default behavior: BAT, PowerShell files always have CRLF line endings.
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.ps1 text eol=crlf
