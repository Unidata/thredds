<BODY>
This package contains the OPeNDAP ASCII client. These classes are used directly
(via the class factory asciiFactory) by the AbstractServlet class to provide the
ASCII response from a OPeNDAP Server. The class implementations contain the
logic for flattening the complex OPeNDAP data structures into columns of comma
delimited ascii text.
