Hi John,

Sorry for the delay in response.  You can view our latest ASCII versions of BUFR Table B (versions 13 and 14) at ftp://ftp.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/dmqab/jator/BUFR_tables/  Please do let us know if you manage to spot any errors or omissions.

FYI Dennis, we've had some recent discussions up here in NCO about getting back to this long-neglected effort to get all of these tables into some kind of database.  That way, the information could easily be exported as, e.g. the above ASCII files, or as HTML for your online Table B, etc.  And whenever WMO provides updates they could be easily ingested as input into such a database.  The project has obviously been dormant for quite some time but has never gone completely off the radar screen.  We'll see if we can get some traction under this in the near future.  Scott Jacobs has some ideas too.

Hi John,

I have an ASCII version of our local Table B - see ftp://ftp.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/dmqab/jator/BUFR_tables/bufrtab.TableB_LOC_0_7_1

I haven't had a chance to generate a corresponding local Table D yet, so at this point Dennis's HTML page is the best documentation we have for that.
