Here are the pointers I promised:

ADDE point URLs:

The ADDE point protocol allows you to query a dataset using
any combination of parameters through a "select" clause.
You can read more about in the McIDAS Programmer's reference at:

http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mug/prog_man/2003/access-4.html#37283

For the Java client, a request would look like (from the
edu.wisc.ssec.mcidas.adde.AddePointDataReader javadoc):

AddePointDataReader interface for McIDAS ADDE point data sets. Simulates 
a McIDAS PTLIST output using an ADDE URL if toString() method is used. 
Note that units are ignored by this client, default units are used.

  URLs must all have the following format
    adde://host/point?keyword_1=value_1&keyword_2=value_2

  there can be any valid combination of the following supported keywords:

    group=<groupname>         ADDE group name
    descr=<descriptor>        ADDE descriptor name
    pos=<position>            request an absolute or relative ADDE
                                position number
    select=<select clause>    to specify which data is required
    param=<param list>        what parameters to return
    num=<max>                 maximum number of obs to return (def=1)
    user=<user_id>            ADDE user identification
    proj=<proj #>             a valid ADDE project number
    trace=<0/1>               setting to 1 tells server to write debug
                                trace file (imagedata, imagedirectory)
    version=1                 ADDE version number, currently 1

  the following keywords are required:

    group
    descr

  an example URL might look like:
    adde://rtds/point?group=neons&type=metar

The combination of select and param determines what you get sent
back.  You can query the dataset with a request like:

adde://adde.ucar.edu/point?group=rtptsrc&descr=sfchourly

which returns all the parameters for the first point in the file.
This would be like getting a list of all the variables in a netCDF
file.

Each point object in McIDAS-X contains five blocks of information.

     * The parameter block contains a list of the parameter names
       in the point object returned by the server.
     * The unit block contains a list of units for the parameters
       returned by the server.
     * The scale block contains a list of scaling factors for the
       floating- point values returned by the server.
     * The form block contains a list of the return forms for each
       of the parameters.
     * The data block contains the actual data values returned by
       the server.

AddePointDataReader allows you to get the data in either
param order [numparams][numobs] or ob order [numobs][numparams].
It also has methods for getting the paramter names, units (McIDAS
unit identifiers - can be converted to udunits through
visad.jmet.MetUnits.makeSymbol(String mcUnit)), and scaling factors.

Again, with the select clause, you can ask most anything you want
to subset the data.  Think of it as a powerful constraint expression
in DODS.  You can do things like specify time ranges, specific
state data, lat/lon boundaries, temperatures in a particular range,
etc.

The param keyword specifies which parameters will be returned.

So for metar data, we make the request:

adde://adde.ucar.edu/pointdata?compress=true&port=112&debug=true&version=1&
user=idv&proj=0&group=RTPTSRC&descr=SFCHOURLY&select='LAT 39.5 40.5;LON 
104.5 105.5'&pos=0&num=all&param=day time

To get a list of all "day" and "time" values for all stations in the
latlon bounding box to populate our time selection list.  (there is
no way to query a point dataset to find out what times are available
like you can for images).  We could do this for all stations, but that
would take a lot of time.  This is one area where it would be nice
to have a DQC that I could query to get the times.

When we actually get the data, we do a request like:

adde://adde.ucar.edu/pointdata?compress=true&port=112&debug=true&version=1&
user=idv&proj=0&group=RTPTSRC&descr=SFCHOURLY&select='time 12,15,16;type 
0'&num=all

To get all observations for 12, 15 and 16 z for the current day.
We use the "type" selection to only select the main hour observations
(as opposed to the intermediate or special obs).  We request all
parameters and let the user subselect what they want on the client
to display only particular parameters.  Since we don't know
a priori which params they want and it's easier to read from
the local data instead of making another request for a new
param, this approach works.

Once we have the data, we convert to a VisAD FieldImpl of format:

(index -> (tuple of parameters))

We then have utility methods that take the FieldImpl and convert
it to a format of

(index -> (ucar.unidata.data.point.PointOb))

A PointOb is like your Observation where it has a:

EarthLocation/NamedLocation      (Station)
DataTime                         (Date)
Data                             (Observation)

For the netCDF data, you can look at any of the _metar.nc and
_syn.nc files in /local/ldm/data/pub/decoded/netcdf/surface or
MADIS METAR files.

With these, we take use the generic VisAD netCDF reader (Plain)
to read in the data and pull out all the variables indexed by
nrec which gives us:

(nrec -> (tuple of parameters))

then we use a similar routine to convert from this format to:

(index -> (ucar.unidata.data.point.PointOb))

The only differences between the ADDE and netCDF conversion routines
are the sections of code to find the day/time variables and the
station information.  This could probably be refactored to avoid
code duplication much like you have with the conventions for
grid files.

Once we have this structure, we can reorder to sort by time for
doing animations of station plots.

Improvements we would like to make:

- Adding a widget to subselect the region of interest.
- Get times for all files in the dataset.  Right now it only
   goes after today's time.
- Support for relative times.  This can be problematic because
   it could mean spanning multiple files which would be separate
   requests.
- subselection by parameter (this has been requested by RAP
   for their netCDF files)


Let me know if you have questions on any of the above.
