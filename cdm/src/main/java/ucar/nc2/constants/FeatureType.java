/*
1) The CF discrete sampling proposal will be the recommended one for point data when thats finalized. Unfortunately, it will be somewhat different from whats gone before. The CF: prefix is dropped until the namespace proposal can be completed. So those feature types are now proposed to be:

    * point: one or more parameters measured at a set of points in time and space
    * timeSeries: a time-series of data points at the same location, with varying time
    * trajectory: a connected set of data points along a 1D curve in time and space
    * profile: a set of data points along a vertical line
    * timeSeriesProfile: a time-series of profiles at a named location
    * trajectoryProfile: a collection of profiles which originate along a trajectory

The CDM will be backwards compatible, including:

    *   accepting the CF: prefix
    *   being case insensitive
    *   "station" and "stationTimeSeries"as aliases for "timeSeries"
    *   "stationProfile" as alias for "timeSeriesProfile"
    *   "section" as alias for "trajectoryProfile"

I know that CF wants to standardize on other feature types also. Its hard to anticipate what they will come with, but its likely:

    * grid
    * swath

maybe:

    * image
    * radial
    * unstructuredGrid
