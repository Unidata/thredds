/**
 * Manages a dynamic collection of MFile objects.
 * An MFile must have the property that
 * <pre>  NetcdfDataset.open(MFile.getPath, ...); </pre>
 * should work.
 *
 * <p> A CollectionManager implements the <collection> element.
 *
<h3>collection element</h3>
<p>A <strong>collection</strong> element defines the collection of datasets. </p>
<pre>&lt;<strong>collection</strong> <strong>spec</strong>=&quot;/data/ldm/pub/native/satellite/3.9/WEST-CONUS_4km/WEST-CONUS_4km_3.9_#yyyyMMdd_HHmm#.gini$&quot;
            <strong>name</strong>=&quot;WEST-CONUS_4km&quot; <strong>olderThan</strong>=&quot;1 min&quot; <strong></strong><strong>olderThan</strong>=&quot;15 min&quot; /&gt;
</pre>

The XML Schema:
<pre>
&lt;xsd:complexType name=&quot;collectionType&quot;&gt;
  1)  &lt;xsd:attribute name=&quot;spec&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot; use=&quot;required&quot;/&gt;

  6)  &lt;xsd:attribute name=&quot;timePartition&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;<br /></pre>
<p>where</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>spec</strong>: <a href="CollectionSpecification.html">collection specification</a> string (required).</li>
  <li><strong>name</strong>: collection name <em><strong>must be unique in all of your TDS catalogs</strong></em>.
    This is used for external triggers and as an easy to read identifier for indexing, logging and debugging.
    If missing, the spec string is used (not a good idea in the context of the TDS). </li>
  <li><strong>olderThan</strong> (optional): Only files whose lastModified date is older than this are included.
 This excludes files that are in the process of being written. However, it only applies to newly found files, that is,
 once a file is in the collection it is not removed because it got updated.</li>
  <li><strong>dateFormatMark</strong> (optional): the collection specification string can only extract dates from the file name,
 as opposed to the file path, which includes all of the parent directory names. Use the <em>dateFormatMark</em> in order to extract
 the date from the full path. <em>Use this OR a date extrator in the specification string, but not both.</em></li>
  <li><strong>timePartition</strong> (optional):: experimental, not complete yet.</li>
</ol>
