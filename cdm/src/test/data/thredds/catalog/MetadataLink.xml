    <documentation type="summary"> The SAGE III Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment (SOLVE) was a measurement campaign designed to examine the     processes controlling ozone levels at mid- to high latitudes. Measurements were made in the Arctic high-latitude region in winter using the NASA     DC-8 and ER-2 aircraft, as well as balloon platforms and ground-based instruments. The mission also acquired correlative data needed to     validate the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III satellite measurements that will be used to quantitatively assess high-latitude     ozone loss. SOLVE is co-sponsored by the Upper Atmosphere Research Program (UARP), Atmospheric Effects of Aviation Project (AEAP),     Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling and Analysis Program (ACMAP), and Earth Observing System (EOS) of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise     (ESE) as part of the validation program for the SAGE III instrument.

      <documentation type="rights"> These files have been created from data  files available at the NASA ESPO data archive.  For each flight, the individual measurement files have been averaged at 1 minute, merged into single files, and saved in NetCDF format by NCAR/ACD  (F.Wu and  L.Emmons). Please consult the original files for additional information regarding the measurement techniques and comments on interpreting the data. Users of these data files are expected  to follow the NASA ESPO Archive guidelines for use of the SOLVE data, including consulting with the PIs of the individual measurements  for interpretation and credit.
