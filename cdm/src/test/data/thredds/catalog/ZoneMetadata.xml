<documentation type="summary"> The SAGE III Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment (SOLVE) was a measurement campaign 
 designed to examine the processes controlling ozone levels at mid- to high latitudes. Measurements 
 were made in the Arctic high-latitude    region in winter using the NASA DC-8 and ER-2 aircraft, 
 as well as balloon platforms and ground-based instruments. </documentation > 

<documentation type="rights"> Users of these data files are expected  to follow the NASA ESPO Archive guidelines for use 
  of the SOLVE data, including consulting with the PIs of the individual measurements  for interpretation and credit.
