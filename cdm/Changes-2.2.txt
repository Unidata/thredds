      where same variable is used for both coordinate system and transform.
  * FileWriter allows 0 in umlimited dimension

Changes in version 2.2.17
 Features
  * default log4j.xml in resources directory
  * Netcdf3iosp: dont validate Attribute names.probably have same problem with variable and dimensions??
  * ucar.nc2.util.xml.RuntimeConfigParser: read XML config file with runtime classes, grib tables to be loaded.
  * ucar.nc2.dt.TypedDatasetFactory : new framework for plugging in TypedDataset implementations
  * ForecastModelRunSingleCollection: fmrc files have single hour in them
  * ForecastModelRunCollection, (fmrc) Aggregation.
  * ForecastModelInventory: keep vertical coordinates of length 1; write layer coordinate with low,high syntax.
  * GRIB: handle vertical coordinates with multiple values, considered as bounds.
    Allow fmrcDefinition.xml to be passed in to determine the coordinate system.
  * FileWriter converts DataType STRING to CHAR. doesnt work for record variables yet.
  * Grib files: vertical coordinates variables with two values now are represented by their midpoint; a "cell boundary"
      variable is added. This fixes some of the "duplicate record" warnings in Grib files.
  * GridCoordSystem.isRegularSpatial() - remove Z axis from test, to allow non-regular variables in WCS
  * NetcdfFile: add bzip2 uncompression
  * NcML: add forecastModelRunCollection aggregation
  * Refactor the GeoGrid API - now use ucar.nc2.dt.Grid* interfaces; add ensemble, runtime dimensions.
    GridCoordSystem allows time to depend on runtime.
  * Variable.slice()
 API changes
  * NetcdfFileWriteable: addUnlimitedDimension, createNew and openExisting with default fill mode = true
  * VariableEnhanced interface: remove getOriginalVariable(), now package private on VariableDS.
  * new Grid processing moved to ucar.nc2.dt.grid, old one (deprecated) stays in ucar.nc2.dataset.grid. Some tweaks on the
    new grid interface, since we no longer have to be strictly backwards compatible.
  * CoordinateAxis1D now looks for bounds (using CF-1 bounds attribute convention) check if contiguous.
    CoordinateAxis1D add isLayer(), check for _Coordinate.ZisLayer attribute.
  * VariableDS uses ProxyReader interface, rather than Aggregation directly.
  * AxisType.Ensemble, AxisType.RunTime
  * GeoGridCoordSys.getTimeCoordinate() implements ucar.nc2.dt.GridCoordSystem:
    getTimeAxis() returns CoordinateAxis instead of CoordinateAxis1D.
    add getTimeAxis1D(), getTimeAxisForRun.
  * GeoGrid : getLevels(), getTimes() returns List, not ArrayList; implements ucar.nc2.dt.GridDaatatype
  * CoordinateSystem: remove get/setDataType(), make setImplicit() protected.
  * Variable.getRanges() vs .getSectionRanges(). Remove isSection(), getRangesAll() until we understand use case.
  * remove old RadialDataset interfaces and implementations : only RadialDatasetSweep is used
 Bugs
  * try to figure out when file: needs to be added to location in NcML
  * relax CoordinateAxis1D.isRegular() to 5.0e-3 tolerance
  * cant (necessarily) use FastIterator on convertScaleOffset!
  * cleanup ucar.nc2.util.NetworkUtils.resolve() for file: baseURLS. only reletive URLS not starting with / are supported. This is
    apparently different from the behavior of URI.resolve(), so may be trouble, but it allows NcML absolute location to be specified without
    the file: prefix.
  * UnidataPointObsDataset: fix various bugs, let altitude field be optional
  * Cleanup Vertical Transforms (use variable name, not numbers in parameters), review
  * Nexrad2 IOSP: recover from bad bzip, deal with missing data in the coordinates
  * WRF netcdf output: projection info missing when version < 2, may be wrong, give warning in userInfo.
  * ucar.nc2.dataset.transform.VExplicitField had wrong value for existingDataField parameter.
  * parse polar_stereographic projection according to CF
  * StringUtil.replace() bug
  * DODS: distinguish netcdf name from dods name (again!), problem is escape chars. Still work to do in data reading (ConvertD2N)
  * when creating a section, always use this, not orgVar, so scale/offset is in the read chain.
  * scale/offset enhance: valid_range must be wider (>=) than packed data to interpret as unpacked units. Also,
    bug with getOriginalVariable(), preventing correct scaling
  * VariableDS: grid subsetting and aggregation not working together.
  * if projection CoordinateTransform missing units, look for units on GeoX axis. (CF compliance)
  * ucar.ma2.Range.contains() off-by-one
  * NcML aggregation caching wasnt working correctly.
 ToolsUI
  * CoordSysTable : show values as Date contenxt menu on coordinate axis table
  * GridViewer: 2D lat/lon, MFlowLayout
  * default nj22Config.xml in home/.unidata
  * look for -nj22Config <filename> on command line

  * dods client now allows compression ("Accept_Deflate"), previous bug made it too slow.
      however, it may still slow things down on a fast network.
  * NcML aggregation element processed first, so nested objects exist and can be modified by other NcML elements.
  * Nexrad2 iosp uses more accurate station table locations.

  * PointCollection.getData return DataIterator, so that the IOException can be declared.
  * RadialDatasetSweep is new interface, other RadialDataset interfaces will be removed.
  * IOSP.readNestedData() remove flatten, handle flatten=false in NetcdfFile.readMemberData(); this allows IOSPs to be simpler
  * static DateUnit methods are removed, they are not thread safe, so we are forcing them to be changed. Use DateFormatter.
 Bugs
  * CF-1: assignment of vertical transforms may require time axis in coordinate system.
  * gini iosp : cache only if < Variable.defaultSizeToCache
  * dodsfile not always calling finish()
  * bugs in gini, nids, dmsp iosp on reading section with  ranges of length one, needs sectionNoReduce().

========================================
Changes from Java-Netcdf version 2.1

Package ucar.nc2

    Adds a "Pluggable Service Provider" layer for the actual I/O. This factors out specific code for reading HDF5 vs
      netCDF version 1 file formats.
    Also have a number of "I/O Service Providers" for non NetCDF file formats, eg GRIB, NEXRAD, etc.

DataType

   1. Add DataType STRUCTURE.
   2. Use DataType STRING for variable length array of chars.
   3. Use DataType CHAR for fixed length array of chars as in nc2 files. HDF5 has both fixed and variable length.

Attribute

   1. Use STRING DataType, don’t use CHAR.
   2. Allow Array of Strings.
   3. remove public Object getValue() , add Array getValues()

Dimension

   1. Allow Dimensions that are not “shared”, i.e. are private to a Variable, for HDF5 and DODS: boolean isShared();
      Only shared Dimensions appear in the NetcdfFile.getDimensions() list.
   2. We need to press OpenDAP and HDF5 to add shared Dimensions to their data models.

Group
   1. logical container for variables, dimensions, attributes, so looks like old netcdfFIle.
   2. always a "root group" in the netcdfFIle.

Variable

   1. adds convenience methods for scalars, eg double readScalarDouble().
   2. add Structure getParent() for Variables that are inside of a Structure.
   3. read with strides
   4. add section() method, creates a logical section of a Variable. This replaces the equivalent functionality in ucar.ma2.MultiArraySection,
      which is removed.

Sequence

   1. A Sequence is a 1D Variable whose length is unknown until the data is actually read.
   2. This corresponds to the HDF5 "Variable Length" DataType (type = 0) Sequence
   3. This corresponds to the DODS Sequence datatype.

Structure

   1. A subclass of Variable, is a container for other Variables, may be nested. This handles both arrays of Structures
      and scalar Structures as a rank-0 array, with some convenience routines for accessing scalar Structures.
   2. Generally, the programmer can assume that the data in a Structure are stored together, so that it is efficient to
      read a Structure all at once, then access the Variable data through the Arrays in the StructureData.

StructureData

   1. Container of the data for a Structure, analogous to how Array contains the data for a Variable.

Package ucar.ma2

   1. Remove MultiArray, IOArray, Array and Index interfaces; make ArrayAbstract into Array, IndexImpl into Index.
   2. Allow Array of Reference types. NetCDF will use String and StructureData.
   3. Use List of Range for section operations.
   4. Ranges can be specified by a String in fortran 90 syntax
