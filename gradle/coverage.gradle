/*
 * Ordinarily, I'd be able to configure the "coveralls" task by using the "coveralls(Closure)" dynamic method added to
 * Project when the above plugin is applied. However, the plugin also adds an extension with the same name (see
 * http://goo.gl/GVE4v6). As a result, Project now has TWO dynamic methods with the "coveralls(Closure)" signature.
 *
 * Which method takes precedence: the one that configures the extension or the one that configures the task? I can't
 * find a definitive answer, but the Gradle docs (http://goo.gl/KPXLpf) seem to indicate that the extension wins
 * (it appears earlier in the list--hardly definitive, I know).
 *
 * Operating under this assumption, we must explicitly indicate that we are configuring the "coveralls" task.
 * Why not just create a new task of type CoverallsTask? Something like "task coverallsReport(type: CoverallsTask)"?
 *
 * Unfortunately, that gives an error: "Extension of type 'CoverallsPluginExtension' does not exist", originating
 * from here: http://goo.gl/HAZk1L. The behavior does not occur when the task is defined in the root build script,
 * meaning it's most likely a Gradle bug, not a coveralls-gradle-plugin bug. That's not surprising: there are lots
 * of weird and poorly-defined limitations about what you can and can't do in a script plugin.
