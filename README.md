# Unidata's THREDDS Project

The THREDDS project is developing middleware to bridge the gap between data
providers and data users. The goal is to simplify the discovery and use of
scientific data and to allow scientific publications and educational materials
to reference scientific data. The mission of THREDDS is for students, educators
and researchers to publish, contribute, find, and interact with data relating
to the Earth system in a convenient, effective, and integrated fashion.

The THREDDS project consists mainly of two software packages and two related
XML encodings:

* the netCDF-Java/CDM library;
* the NetCDF Markup Language (NcML);
* the THREDDS Data Server (TDS); and
* the THREDDS Catalog specification.

Source code for each of these is available from GitHub at

* https://github.com/Unidata/thredds

The latest released and snapshot software artifacts (.jar and .war files e.g.)
are available from Unidata's Maven repositories

* https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/repository/unidata-releases/
* https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/repository/unidata-snapshots/

To build the software yourself, follow [this tutorial](docs/website/netcdf-java/tutorial/SourceCodeBuild.adoc).

as well as in the LICENSE.txt file accompanying the software.

More details on each of these can be found below.

## netCDF-Java/CDM

The netCDF Java library provides an interface for scientific data access. It can be
used to read scientific data from a variety of file formats including netCDF, HDF,
GRIB, BUFR, and many others. By itself, the netCDF-Java library can only write
netCDF-3 files. It can write netCDF-4 files by using JNI to call the netCDF-C
library. It also implements Unidata's Common Data Model (CDM) to provide data
geolocation capabilities.

For more information about netCDF-Java/CDM, see the netCDF-Java web page at

* https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/

and the CDM web page at

https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/4.6/netcdf-java/CDM/index.html

You can obtain a copy of the latest released version of netCDF-Java software
from

A mailing list, netcdf-java@unidata.ucar.edu, exists for discussion of all
things netCDF-Java/CDM including announcements about netCDF-Java/CDM bugs,
fixes, enhancements, and releases. For information about how to subscribe, see

We appreciate feedback from users of this package. Please send comments,
suggestions, and bug reports to <support-netcdf-java@unidata.ucar.edu>.
Please identify the version of the package.

## NetCDF Markup Language (NcML)

NcML is an XML representation of netCDF metadata, it approximates the header
information one gets from a netCDF file with the "ncdump -h" command. NcML is
similar to the netCDF CDL (network Common data form Description Language),
except, of course, it uses XML syntax.

Beyond simply describing a netCDF file, it can also be used to describe changes
to existing netCDF files. A limited number of tools, mainly netCDF-Java based
tools, support these features of NcML

For more information about NcML, see the NcML web page at

https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ncml/

## THREDDS Data Server (TDS)

The THREDDS Data Server (TDS) provides metadata and data access to scientific
datasets. Datasets can be served through OPeNDAP, OGC's WMS and WCS, HTTP, and other
remote data access protocols. It can be configured to aggregate a collection of
datasets so the collection is seen as a single dataset when viewed through the
various data access protocols. The TDS is a server-based system that can be easily
installed in any servlet container such as Apache Tomcat.

For more information about the TDS, see the TDS web page at

* https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/tds/

You can obtain a copy of the latest released version of TDS software from

* https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/tds/

A mailing list, thredds@unidata.ucar.edu, exists for discussion of the TDS and
THREDDS catalogs including announcements about TDS bugs, fixes, enhancements,
and releases. For information about how to subscribe, see the

## THREDDS Catalogs

THREDDS Catalogs can be thought of as representing logical directories of on-line
data resources. They are encoded as XML and provide a place for annotations and
other metadata about the data resources. These XML documents are how THREDDS-enabled
data consumers find out what data is available from data providers.

THREDDS Catalog documentation (including the specification) is available at

* https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/4.6/tds/catalog/
