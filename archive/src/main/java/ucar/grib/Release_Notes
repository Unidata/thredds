8.28 Monday Nov 15, 2010
Record duplication code, duplicates are skipped from index

8.27 Wednesday July 21, 2010
Grib2 local parameters are now working, the table needs populated. Only center 8 local
parameters have been added. 

8.26 Monday July 12, 2010
Refactored Grib parameters with intervals, also added parameters that are interval and
non-intervals. ie Downward_Short__Wave_Rad_Flux.  Added Grib1 New Delhi and updated
French parameter tables

8.25 Thursday May 27, 2010
Added parameter table name to the missing parameter names and warning messages.

prepended to history.

8.24 Monday May 17, 2010
For the new NDFD files that have the lat/lon only differing in the 3rd decimal
place, there is now a closeEnough check. This check assumes these lat/lon are
equal.

8.23 Monday May 17, 2010
Grib2 data with product type = 8 are treated as accumulation data.

8.22 Monday April 26, 2010
Modified Grib1PDSVariable for off by one when accessing isEnsemble() for CMC
data. Modified Grib2PDSVariable so length check is zero based. For Grib1, added
WMO tables as defaults when a site table doesn't exist.

8.21 Friday April 9, 2010
Refactored Missing Parameters for Grib1 and Grib2. Updated Grib1 table jma_0_v3.tab.
Updated Grib1 and Grib2 centers and sub-centers tables. NCEP Model tables. Added CF
compliant Global attributes title institution source.

8.20 Friday March 26, 2010
Refactored fix for Grib2 Satellite PDS 31 products, error in documentation. Added Nasa
data Grib1 tables for 7-12-130 and 221-221-1 (site, sub-site, table)   If Grib2 Category
or Parameter is > 191 and unknown, then it is designated as LocalUse


8.19 Tuesday March 16, 2010
Refactored Fixed for Time Ranges for Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) Monthly 
Products.

8.18 Monday March 15, 2010 Fixed for Complex packing that has the number of bits = 0
for groups, ie setting all the Groups values to zero.  Refactored ShowGribIndex to use
GribReadIndex

8.17 Friday March 12, 2010
Fixed Time Ranges for Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) Monthly Products 

8.16 Date ? Curvilinear grids set grid units to degrees. Made sure time units are
considered in time calculations. Grib2 simplePacking added missing value Made Grib1
and Grib2 the same for GridDefRecord.RADIUS_SPHERICAL_EARTH Axis are
now in meters for shape 3 - oblate earth defined by producer

8.15 Monday January 22, 2010
Added scanning_mode flag to Grib GDSs. Updated Grib2 parameter table

8.14 Monday January 4, 2010
Made modifications so the GDS values would not have discrepencies in the 4th/5th
place digit after the decimal points.  Coded the ratio processing in Grib2GDSVariables.
Updated TestBinaryTextIndexes and TestCompareGribPDSGDSSections test cases.
Added Grib2 parameters 3 1 98 and 3 1 99 as MPE data placeholders 

8.13 Tuesday December 29,2009
Changed the HybridSigmaPressure to do a reduce() on the Pressure array when the
rank was equal to 3.
Added a flush to the Grib(1|2)ExtendIndex and also a sleep 2 if the index is
going to be immediately read. 

8.12 Tuesday December 15,2009
Changed the projection names to be CF compliant. Also, updated code tables.

8.11 Monday December 14, 2009
Added table entry for center 161 subcenter 1 version 3 ie U.S. NOAA Office of
Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. Updated nceptab_3.tab with information from
wgrib source program.

8.10 Fix for Guam wind_dir grib2 files that have nb (number bits in all groups) set
to 0. Radar Grib2 files names are now created correctly.

8.9 Fix for write then read Grib index bug, usually only happens on ML

8.8 Hybrid variables according to CF conventions.

8.7 Time_bounds variables are now 2 dimensions. Added parameter 197 to the
Grib2 parameter table for category Forecast Radar Imagery. Grib2Tables fixed
getTimeRangeUnitName() for 3, 6, 12 hours returns

8.6 Total precipitation implementation with accumulation time inserted into
variable name.

8.5 Changed probability variable . to a p in lower and upper limit and added probability
word to the variable name. Added junit-4.5.jar to release. Redid the SREF derived 
definition files.

8.4 Changed read to readFully for DataInputStreams, added table nceptab_138_130.tab
Esemble testing

8.3 Changed the suffix of the index file to gbx8, added GribIndexName, 
update Test file to use gbx8, added Sigma Vertical levels
processing, Ensemble processing updated, enhanced ScanningMode flag for 
Grib1. 

8.2 Second Order Spatial Differencing code was truly implemented because
there was a test file. GDS Winds flag was changed to VectorComponentFlag
and elevated to the CDM layer for use in attributes for variables. For error
type of Generating Processes, the error suffix is now appended to the variable
names.

8.1 Converted many routines to use Grib(1|2)(GDS|PDS)Variables methods instead
of the Grib(1|2)(GDS|PDS)DefinitionSection routines.

8.0 This release is a major refactor of the Grib package to insert the PDS and GDS
sections of the Grib record into the index as byte[]. The implementation included
wrapper classes of the byte[] to produce the variables. It also include classes
Grib1Tables and Grib2Tables for all static Tables.

7.1 Internal only release, prototyped byte[] PDS insertion into index.

7.0 The main modification was to use the binary values for all the record fields in
the index but have the same structure as the 6.x index. Ensemble grib processing was
prototyped. The Grib Iosp was changed to use Grid Iosp code, so there is only one
code base for processing Grib code. The ucar/grid package was implemented, it
contains GridDefRecord, GridIndex, GridParameter, GridRecord and GridTableLookup
classes. There were performance modifications of lazy reading of bitmap and setting
the RandomAccessFile buffer size when creating an index.
The Index, Grib1Indexer,
Grib2Indexer, TableLookup, Grib1Lookup, and Grib2Lookup classes were deprecated.

6.5  Final version of the text index, it was updated to 6.5 because it is used in
conjuction with the binary index. This was the basis for the Branch RB-GRIB-6.0 that
contained grib table additions and modifications. Grib2 missing value fixes were also
included.

6.0.18 added jpeg2000 src into Grib tree ucar/jpeg

6.0.17 added jpeg-1.0.jar because of conflict with system installed jpeg jar
 
6.0.16 added ucar/grid package

6.0.15 added tables for Netherlands, John did threads scan of code

6.0.14 support for grid 87

6.0.13 added table for NWS MDL data

6.0.12 Don fixed winds true/relative, mods to ProductDefinition 8 and 9

6.0.11 added grib1 table for japanese 34 0 3 and 35 0 3 jma_0_v3.tab

6.0.10 productDefinition == 2 in PDS was implemented, also junit test created

6.0.9 updated the grib2 parameter table

6.0.8 added Grib2 level 253 & 254 + others. Created scripts to create grib2StdQuantities.xml
from scraping web pages instead of hand entering.

6.0.7 IndexExtender didn't handle negative GDSkeys correctly.

6.0.6 change GDSkey creation from checkSum to hashCode calculations, deleted
ScanMode line from GDS section of the index.

6.0.5 added new parms for table nceptab_129.tab for wrf and added
NotSupportedException in Grib2ProductDefinitionSection class for NCEP.

6.0.4 Beijing fixes, new tables, pds 113 time range, century 0 ->20

6.0.3 nb for space products is 0 based, not 1 based

6.0.2 fixed Grib2ProductDefinitionSection template 8 Time range processing

6.0.1 updated Grib2 parameter table from NCEP, started work on Orthogonal Grids(not complete)
6.0.0 grib1 index, added table info to end of rows
