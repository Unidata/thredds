03/03/2011 Atsushi (AShimazaki@wmo.int) sends me XML tables.
 - here is where they apparently live at WMO, see link on this page:
   http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/WMOCodes/TDCFtables.html#TDCFtables

12/7/2011
 - edward glen (edward.glen@metservice.com) sends a file from center (canadian met) with parameter 0-4-192.
   from this page: http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/grib/what_is_GRIB_e.html referencing NCEP (at bottom), Ive decided to
    map all of center 54 to NCEP tables.

12/8/2011
 - jeff.brogden@noaa.gov sent me a new HRRR (hi res rapid refresh) model output E:/work/brogden/hrrr_20111207-1400F0000.grib2
   center is 59 with lots of local params. i am going to assume all FSL files should use NCEP center 7 tables

12/8/2011 new WMO tables found from http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/WMOCodes/TDCFtables.html#TDCFtables
 - GRIB2 8.0
 - BUFR 17.0 (not integrated yet)
 - Common Codes 02Nov11
 - move older tables into src/main/sources to reduce jar size

01/30/2011
 - correction to 0-15-3 (Vertically Integrated Liquid)

    Hello John,

    The correction was proposed by NOAA/NCEP.  It was reported that the proposer has not seen the data in km/m.  You can therefore practically correct the unit.
    The approval process by WMO on the correction is underway, but I think it will be corrected in May 2012.

    Best regards,
    Atsushi

02/02/2012 FSL HRRR  http://ruc.noaa.gov/hrrr/GRIB2Table.txt
 - turns out FSL local params are very different from NCEP
 - add FslLocalTables using C:\dev\github\thredds\grib\src\main\resources\resources\grib2\local\Fsl-hrrr.csv
 - There are a few possible conflicts, as seen below (your table is p1, WMO is p2).
The first 3 are differences in units, the second 3 are possible problems in parameter names.

also a few random problems i see:

2) the description is sometimes level dependent. here that fails:

 float Specific_humidity_sigma(time=1, sigma=50, y=1059, x=1799);
     :long_name = "Specific humidity @ Sigma level";
     :units = "kg/kg";
     :missing_value = NaNf; // float
     :description = "Specific humidity at 2 m above ground level";
