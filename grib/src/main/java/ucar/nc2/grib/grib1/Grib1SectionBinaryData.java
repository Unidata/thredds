  Section 4 – Binary data section
  Octet   Contents
  1–3     Length of section
  4       Flag (see Code table 11) (first 4 bits). Number of unused bits at end of Section 4 (last 4 bits)
  5–6     Scale factor (E)
  7–10    Reference value (minimum of packed values)
  11      Number of bits containing each packed value
  12–Variable, depending on the flag value in octet 4

  Note: A negative value of E shall be indicated by setting the high-order bit (bit 1) in the left-hand octet to 1 (on).

  Code table 11 – Flag
  Bit Value Meaning
  1   0     Grid-point data
      1     Spherical harmonic coefficients
  2   0     Simple packing
      1     Complex or second-order packing
  3   0     Floating point values (in the original data) are represented
      1     Integer values (in the original data) are represented
  4   0     No additional flags at octet 14
      1     Octet 14 contains additional flag bits

  The following gives the meaning of the bits in octet 14 ONLY if bit 4 is set to 1. Otherwise octet 14 contains
  regular binary data.

  Bit Value Meaning
  5         Reserved – set to zero
  6   0     Single datum at each grid point
      1     Matrix of values at each grid point
  7   0     No secondary bit-maps
      1     Secondary bit-maps present
  8   0     Second-order values constant width
      1     Second-order values different widths
  9–12 Reserved for future use
