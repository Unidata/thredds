Notes on CFSR dataset

 - 01/28/2012 from email from bob dattore

    In ds093.2, the monthly mean dataset, we did not make any modifications, but NCEP did not encode the statistical processing fields
    (octets 47-58 and 59-70) according to the GRIB2 standard.  Instead, they did their own thing, which is described here:
    http://dss.ucar.edu/datasets/ds093.2/docs/time_ranges.html.

    ds093.2 CFSR Time Range Specification
    NCEP does not follow the GRIB2 standard to indicate the statistical processing time range for the CFSR monthly means.
    Instead, they specify octets 47-58 and 59-70 in Product Template 4.8 as follows:

    Octet(s)	Description
        47	From NCEP Code Table 4.10
        48	Should be ignored
        49	Should be ignored
        50-53	Number of grids used in the average
        54	Should be ignored
        55-58	This is "P2" from the GRIB1 format
        59	From NCEP Code Table 4.10
        60	Should be ignored
        61	Should be ignored
        62-65	This is "P2 minus P1"; P1 and P2 are fields from the GRIB1 format
        66	Should be ignored
        67-70	Should be ignored

    It is unlikely that current GRIB decoders will understand this time range specification, so the times and product types
    for the grids may appear as something very different than what they should. One alternative is to convert the grids to GRIB1 format.

 -01/28/2012 notes

   so for template 8, the following are affected by octets >= 47 :   TimeInterval[] readTimeIntervals().
   so the time unit is ok:
         47: Statistical process == 193 (table 4.10: Average of N forecasts)

   special handling:
      55-58: This is "P2" from the GRIB1 format
      62-65: This is "P2 minus P1"; P1 and P2 are fields from the GRIB1 format

    CFS Reanalysis Monthly Mean
     - The Verification time encoded in Section 4 Octets 35-41 are zeroes.
     - The num_in_avg, or the count of the number of points (6hr cycles) averaged within the respective monthly average,
       is encoded in Section 4 Octet 53, possibly 32 bits: 50-53.
     - Section 4 Octet 58 (possibly 32 bits: 55-58) is the length of the averaging period per unit.
       For cycle fractions, this is 24, for complete monthly averages, it is 6.
       The product of this and the num_in_avg {above} should always equal the total number of hours in a respective month.
     - Section 4 Octet 65 is the hours skipped between each calculation component.
     - The original form of these files, as output from NCEP computers, is GRIB1 format, many of these issues cropped up
       when the data was converted from GRIB1 to GRIB2 for considerable storage and transmission savings.  Regardless
       of being in GRIB2 format, they still suffer deficiencies of GRIB1 file metadata.

 guess:
   the "regular" monthly mean is the average value for that month = average of the 4 diurnal means.
   the "diurnal" means are the average values in the interval, not the instantaneous values, so this does match the CF example.
     whats troubling is i dont see a "six hour" interval anywhere.

- possible CF representation:

    dimensions:
      time=4;
      nv=2;

     variables:
      float precipitation(time,lat,lon);
        precipitation:long_name="surface air temperature";
        precipitation:cell_methods="time: sum within days time: mean over days";
        precipitation:units="K";

     double time(time);
        time:climatology="climatology_bounds";
        time:units="days since 2008-01-01";

     double climatology_bounds(time,nv);

    data:
      time="2008-08-01T03:00Z", "2008-08-01T09:00Z", "2008-08-01T15:00Z", "2008-08-01T21:00Z" ;

      climatology_bounds="2008-08-01T00:00Z",  "2008-08-31T06:00Z",
                         "2008-08-01T06:00Z",  "2008-08-31T12:00Z",
                         "2008-08-01T12:00Z",  "2008-08-31T18:00Z",
                         "2008-08-01T18:00Z",  "2008-08-31T24:00Z" ;

  there seem to be 2 elements:

      1) the time coordinate or time interval coordinate

      2) the length of time the statistic is applied (here - 1 month or 31 days)

  one apparently infers the gap between intervals.

      note 124 * 6 = 744 makes me think that "length of avg period per unit" should be 6 ??

   Note that standard MM has "other forecasts at 6-hour intervals"
   Note that diurnal MM has "other forecasts at 24-hour intervals"
   I guess they are referring to the skip?

   How to encode? standard MM is just the monthly average, although maybe the intervals need to be considered ??
