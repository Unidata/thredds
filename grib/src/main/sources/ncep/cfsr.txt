    Record 1: f00: forecast at first time step of 3 mins
    Record 2: f01: forecast (either averaged over 0 to 1 hour, or instantaneous at 1 hour)
    Record 3: f02: forecast (either averaged over 0 to 2 hours, or instantaneous at 2 hours)
    Record 4: f03: forecast (either averaged over 0 to 3 hour, or instantaneous at 3 hours)
    Record 5: f04: forecast (either averaged over 0 to 4 hours, or instantaneous at 4 hours)
    Record 6: f05: forecast (either averaged over 0 to 5 hours, or instantaneous at 5 hours)
    Record 7: f06: forecast (either averaged over 0 to 6 hours, or instantaneous at 6 hours)

    Important Note: The forecast at the first time step (f00) of 3 minutes constitutes
    a spin up of the model physics, and extreme care should be taken when using it
    as a proxy of any type of validation.  IT IS NOT THE ANALYSIS.

  NCAR: http://dss.ucar.edu/datasets/ds093.1/
     "Selected CFSR timeseries products are available at 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 degree horizontal resolutions at hourly
     intervals by combining either 1) the analysis and one- through five-hour forecasts, or 2) the one- through six-hour
     forecasts, for each initialization time"

    from bob dattore (NCAR DSS)
     In ds093.1, the hourly time series dataset, the original files from NCDC contain either 28 or 32 grids per day.
     This is because for each of the four initializations per day, NCEP left in grids which are for the very first time
     step (the 3-minute model spinup).  The metadata make them look like an analysis grid, but they are not.
     Also, for the parameters that are analyzed by CFSR, NCEP also left in the 6-hour forecast grids, which are not
     necessary because there is a new analysis available at the next initialization.  We filtered out the spinup grids,
     and also the 6-hour forecasts for analyzed parameters, so that our files all have 24 grids per day.

  - G:/nomads/cfsr/timeseries/200808/chi200.gdas.200808.grb2
     we see spinup at 0 hour, plus overlap 6 hour forecast and 0 hour at next interval.
     so we see 2 of 8 records are duplicates: records unique=745 total=992 dups=247 (0.248992)

  - Instantaneous fields: Because we use the latest record in the file for each time coordinate, the 6 hour forecast and the 0-hour spin-up are not used,
    in favor of the 0 hour analysis.

  - Interval fields: We decided not to seperate different interval lengths into different variables, because associating
    those variables together would be non-standard.

    We exclude the (0,0) interval records with:

        <gribConfig>
          <intvFilter excludeZero="true"/>
        </gribConfig>

    The time interval coords then look like:

          (0.000000,1.000000) = 1.000000
          (0.000000,2.000000) = 2.000000
          (0.000000,3.000000) = 3.000000
          (0.000000,4.000000) = 4.000000
          (0.000000,5.000000) = 5.000000
          (0.000000,6.000000) = 6.000000
          (6.000000,7.000000) = 1.000000
          (6.000000,8.000000) = 2.000000
          (6.000000,9.000000) = 3.000000
          (6.000000,10.000000) = 4.000000
           ...

    These are called "mixed interval" coordinates.

 - from bob dattore:

    In ds093.2, the monthly mean dataset, we did not make any modifications, but NCEP did not encode the statistical processing fields
    (octets 47-58 and 59-70) according to the GRIB2 standard.  Instead, they did their own thing, which is described here:
    http://dss.ucar.edu/datasets/ds093.2/docs/time_ranges.html.

    ds093.2 CFSR Time Range Specification
    NCEP does not follow the GRIB2 standard to indicate the statistical processing time range for the CFSR monthly means.
    Instead, they specify octets 47-58 and 59-70 in Product Template 4.8 as follows:

    Octet(s)	Description
        47	From NCEP Code Table 4.10
        48	Should be ignored
        49	Should be ignored
        50-53	Number of grids used in the average
        54	Should be ignored
        55-58	This is "P2" from the GRIB1 format
        59	From NCEP Code Table 4.10
        60	Should be ignored
        61	Should be ignored
        62-65	This is "P2 minus P1"; P1 and P2 are fields from the GRIB1 format
        66	Should be ignored
        67-70	Should be ignored

    CFS Reanalysis Hourly Files : Particular Files/GRIB Records
    http://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/modeldata/   (Aug 2011)
     There are temperature at the surface (tmpsfc) records in the ipv*nl files.  These
    records should not be used, more appropriate records can be found in the flx*
    files.
    The ocnh* and ocnf* group contains a variable named “Geometric depth below
    sea surface” which may have their isothermal level mislabeled as all zeroes for
    all the level values.  In cases where this is encountered, the zeroes correspond
    to (in record order): 2.5C, 5.0C, 10.0C, 15.0C, 20.0C, 25.0C, and 28.0C
    isotherms

    this appears to refer to 6-hour, not hourly. or maybe hourly == 6-hour, not timeseries.

CFSRR
    A complete Reforecast of CFS version 2, over the 29-year period (1982-2010) has been created in order to provide stable
    calibration and skill estimates of the new system, for operational seasonal and sub seasonal prediction at NCEP.
    Coupled full 9-month forecasts from initial conditions every 5 days apart (for all 4 c cycles on that day) have been
    made for each calendar year with the T126L64 GFS with half-hourly coupling to the ocean (MOM4 at 1/4° equatorial, 1/2° global).
    Total number of 9-month forecasts is 73x4 for each year, amounting to 8468 forecast runs for the full period.
    In addition to the 9-month runs, there is a full season run from every 0Z cycle over a 12-year period (1999-2010)
    for a total of 4380 runs. There is also a short 45-day forecast from every 6Z, 12Z and 18Z cycle over the same 12-year period
    (1999-2010) for a total of 13140 runs.

  from Dan:

    The result will be either 3 or 4 records for that particular parameter
      (TMP @ 500 mb).
    This constitutes the t(f) for this t(i) and parameter.
    There is a seasonal (3 month) t(f) sequence for each day @ 00Z
       for all parameters in the file type.  If the t(i) day-of-month is the 25th
    or later, the sequence consists of 3 files, otherwise, the current month
    is also included, making 4 files (or records per parameter) in the sequence.

    I can look at the entire collection in the toolsui iosp-grib2-grib2collection by putting a collection spec for the name of the datasets:

      G:/nomads/cfsr/hpr-mms/pgbf/2008/200812/.*grb2

    now im looking at the temperature at 500 mb. there are 15 records, one from each file.

    All of them have:
        ReferenceDate=2008-12-25T00:00:00.000Z
        Ending Date    =2008-12-25T00:00:00.000Z

    If i look at just the five *200901 files, they all have a forecast time of 1 month
    If i look at just the five *200902 files, they all have a forecast time of 2 month
    If i look at just the five *200903 files, they all have a forecast time of 3 month

    however, the time intervals _all_ appear to be one month long, so all intervals look like:

      TimeInterval=(2008-11-25T00:00:00.000Z,2008-12-25T00:00:00.000Z)

    im not sure how to interpret this.

    Also, theres no differernce at all between, eg, the five *200901 records (except the data is different):

     G:/nomads/cfsr/hpr-mms/pgbf/2008/200812/pgbf2008122500.01.200901.avrg.00Z.grb2

    so what are the meanings of these 5 records? Apparently you will need to know the filename to decode (bad dog!)

 - from Dan:

    What you list as the "Ending Date" {or the t(v) as I term it},
    There is a known issue where all the t(v) info is set to t(i) values in the headers.
    I do not know if this, or a offshoot of this, is messing with your decoders.

    In the example wgrib2 commands I gave in the last message, it gives me:

    187:8194041:d=2008122500:TMP:500 mb:1-2 month ave fcst:
    187:8500869:d=2008122500:TMP:500 mb:2-3 month ave fcst:
    187:8452157:d=2008122500:TMP:500 mb:3-4 month ave fcst:

    The statistical period in all the records is 1 month, which is
    somewhat Of a bug since the first record is not 1 month in this case,
    (it is 5 days.)

    I am not exactly sure where wgrib2 is getting the 1,2,3-4 for the total period,
    I will look into this.  I am not using the rigged-up wgrib2 that Wesley
    recently released that auto-corrects the problems in CFSR.

    In the diurnal fraction files (~.hhZ.grb2)
    What they *SHOULD* be is a sequence 3-4 monthly records-
     consisting of 28-31x 6hr periods for a given month
    with a statistical process run on them.  So they will appear to
    have identical t(i) and t(f)'s,   They way the statistical data is
    calculated, however, is different.
