Making a release for CDM/TDS using Gradle

{release.minor} refers to the full, 3-part version, e.g. "4.6.5"
{release.major} refers to the truncated, 2-part version, e.g. "4.6"

1. Prepare ncWMS and threddsIso
   - Detailed instructions can be found in ncwms/docs/internal/release.txt and threddsIso/docs/internal/release.txt.
   - The instructions for the two are very similar.

2. Ensure that there are no uncommitted changes.

3. Pull all of the latest changes from upstream.

4. In "/build.gradle", update the project's version for the release.
   Likely, this means removing the '-SNAPSHOT' prefix, e.g. '4.6.5-SNAPSHOT' to '4.6.5'.

5. In "/gradle/dependencies.gradle", update the "uk.ac.rdg.resc:ncwms" and "EDS:threddsIso" dependencies to the
   versions deployed in step 1. Also, remove any dependencies on SNAPSHOT versions of libraries.

6. Publish the artifacts to Nexus.
   - You need the correct "nexus.username" and "nexus.password" properties defined in your
     "~/.gradle/gradle.properties" file. Ask Christian for those.
   - ./gradlew clean publish
   - Check artifacts at http://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/

7. On www, prepare the FTP directory for the new version of TDS and TDM (best to do from SSH)
  - cd /web/ftp/pub/thredds/{release.major}
  - mkdir {release.minor}
  - move /web/ftp/pub/thredds/{release.major}/current to point to /web/ftp/pub/thredds/{release.major}/{release.minor}
     rm current   (If it exists)
     ln -s {release.minor} current

8. Copy over the TDS war and its security hashes from Nexus, renaming them in the process.
     * wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/tds/{release.minor}/tds-{release.minor}.war -O {release.minor}/thredds.war
     * wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/tds/{release.minor}/tds-{release.minor}.war.md5 -O {release.minor}/thredds.war.md5
     * wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/tds/{release.minor}/tds-{release.minor}.war.sha1 -O {release.minor}/thredds.war.sha1

9. Copy over the TDM fat jar and its security hashes from Nexus, renaming them in the process.
   When renaming, "tdmFat" should become "tdm".
     * wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/tdmFat/{release.minor}/tdmFat-{release.minor}.jar -O {release.minor}/tdm-{release.major}.jar
     * wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/tdmFat/{release.minor}/tdmFat-{release.minor}.jar.sha1 -O {release.minor}/tdm-{release.major}.jar.sha1
     * wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/tdmFat/{release.minor}/tdmFat-{release.minor}.jar.md5 -O {release.minor}/tdm-{release.major}.jar.md5

10. Change permissions of the files you just copied.
    - cd /web/ftp/pub/thredds/{release.major}/{release.minor}
    - chmod 775 .
    - chmod 664 *

11. Copy over ncIdv, netcdfAll, toolsUI and their security hashes from Nexus
    - cd /web/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/v{release.major}
    - wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/ncIdv/{release.minor}/ncIdv-{release.minor}.jar
    - wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/ncIdv/{release.minor}/ncIdv-{release.minor}.jar.md5
    - wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/ncIdv/{release.minor}/ncIdv-{release.minor}.jar.sha1
    - wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/netcdfAll/{release.minor}/netcdfAll-{release.minor}.jar
    - wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/netcdfAll/{release.minor}/netcdfAll-{release.minor}.jar.md5
    - wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/netcdfAll/{release.minor}/netcdfAll-{release.minor}.jar.sha1
    - wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/toolsUI/{release.minor}/toolsUI-{release.minor}.jar
    - wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/toolsUI/{release.minor}/toolsUI-{release.minor}.jar.md5
    - wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/toolsUI/{release.minor}/toolsUI-{release.minor}.jar.sha1

12. Remove symlinks to old versions and create ones to new versions
    - cd /web/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/v{release.major}
    - rm toolsUI-{release.major}.jar netcdfAll-{release.major}.jar ncIdv-{release.major}.jar
    - ln -s toolsUI-{release.minor}.jar toolsUI-{release.major}.jar
    - ln -s netcdfAll-{release.minor}.jar netcdfAll-{release.major}.jar
    - ln -s ncIdv-{release.minor}.jar ncIdv-{release.major}.jar

13. Change permissions of the files you just copied.
    - cd /web/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/v{release.major}
    - chmod 775 .
    - chmod 664 *

14. Mount the www.unidata.ucar.edu:/web/ Samba share to a local directory, if it's not mounted already. The details of
    this will vary based on your OS.
    - On OS X do: Finder->Go->Connect to Server...  Then connect to "smb://www/web".

15. Set the "webdir" and "ftpdir" Gradle properties
    - Open ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
    - Set "webdir" to "{web.mount.dir}/content/software/thredds/v{release.major}/netcdf-java"
    - Set "ftpdir" to "{web.mount.dir}/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/v{release.major}"
    - The value of {web.mount.dir} will likely differ, but mine is "/Volumes/web".
    - So for example, on OS X, my (Christian's) Gradle properties for "webdir" and "ftpdir" are:
        webdir=/Volumes/web/content/software/thredds/v4.6/netcdf-java
        ftpdir=/Volumes/web/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/v4.6

16. Release Web Start to www:/content/software/thredds/v{release.major}/netcdf-java/webstart
    - Make sure that you have the correct gradle.properties (see Christian for info). In particular, you'll need the
      'keystore', 'keystoreAlias', 'keystorePassword', 'webdir', and 'ftpdir' properties defined.
    - Rename old directories
      * cd /content/software/thredds/v{release.major}/netcdf-java/
      * mv webstart webstartOld
    - Update /thredds/ui/netCDFtools.jnlp and /thredds/ui/netCDFtoolsExtraJars.jnlp as needed.
    - Test webstart locally. There are notes above ui/build.gradle/releaseWebstart() about how to do that.
    - Perform release
      * ./gradlew :ui:clean :ui:releaseWebstart
    - If there were no errors and the new Web Start looks good, delete the old stuff.
      * rm -r webstartOld

17. Release Javadoc to www:/content/software/thredds/v{release.major}/netcdf-java/javadoc and javadocAll
    - Rename old directories
      * cd /content/software/thredds/v{release.major}/netcdf-java/
      * mv javadoc javadocOld
      * mv javadocAll javadocAllOld
    - Perform release
      * ./gradlew :cdm:clean :cdm:releaseDocs
      * ./gradlew :ui:clean :ui:releaseDocs
    - If there were no errors and the new Javadoc looks good, delete the old stuff.
      * rm -r javadocOld
      * rm -r javadocAllOld

18. Change permissions of the files you just copied.
    - cd /content/software/thredds/v{release.major}/netcdf-java/
    - find webstart -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
    - find webstart -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
    - find javadoc -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
    - find javadoc -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
    - find javadocAll -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
    - find javadocAll -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;

19. Update Unidata download page(s)
    - check http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/thredds/index.jsp
      * modify www:/content/downloads/thredds/toc.xml as needed
    - check http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/netcdf-java-4/index.jsp
      * modify www:/content/downloads/netcdf/netcdf-java-4/toc.xml as needed

20. Edit www:/web/content/software/thredds/latest.xml to reflect the correct
    {release.minor} version for stable and development. This file is read by all
    TDS > v4.6 to make log entries regarding current stable and development versions
    to give users a heads-up of the need to update.

21. Commit the changes you've made.
    - At the very least, project.version in the root build script should have been modified.
    - Make the commit message something like "Release {release.minor}".

22. Create a tag for the release: "v{release.minor}".
    - In IntelliJ, do VCS->Git->Tag...
    - Apparently tags don't ever get moved from GitHub pull requests. Might need a different way to tag releases.

23. Prepare for next round of development.
    - Update the project version. Increment it and add the "-SNAPSHOT" suffix.
      * For example, if {release.minor}="4.6.5", the next version will be "4.6.6-SNAPSHOT".
    - Commit the change.
      * The commit message should be something like "Begin work on 4.6.6-SNAPSHOT".

24. Push the commits upstream.
    - Be sure to include the tag you created.
      * In IntelliJ, check the "Push Tags" box in the "Push Commits" dialog.

25. Make a release announcement on GitHub.
    - Example: https://github.com/Unidata/thredds/releases/tag/v4.6.4
    - To help create the changelog, examine the pull requests on GitHub. For example, this URL shows all PRs that
      have been merged into "master" since 2016-02-12:
      https://github.com/Unidata/thredds/pulls?q=base%3Amaster+merged%3A%3E%3D2016-02-12

26. Make blog post for the release.
    - Example: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/netcdf-java-library-and-tds1
    - Best to leave it relatively short and just link to the GitHub release.

27. Make a release announcement to the mailing lists: netcdf-java@unidata.ucar.edu and thredds@unidata.ucar.edu
    - Example: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/mailing_lists/archives/netcdf-java/2016/msg00001.html
    - Best to leave it relatively short and just link to the GitHub release.

NOTE 1: In the Maven build, the maven-release-plugin roughly handled steps 2-6 and 21-24 for us. In the future, we
should investigate similar Gradle plugins that offer the same functionality.

NOTE 2: In the future, we should be performing many (all?) of these steps from Jenkins, not our local machine.

Note 3: The latest.xml doc in step 20 is very simple and could probably be updated
        automatically during the release process.
