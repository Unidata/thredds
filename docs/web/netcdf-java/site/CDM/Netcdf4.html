<h1>Mapping between CDM and netCDF-4 Data Models </h1>
<p><em>Draft July 13, 2009</em></p>
<p>The CDM data model is close to, but not identical to the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/workshops/2008/netcdf4/Nc4DataModel.html">netCDF-4 data model</a>. However there is a complete 2-way mapping between the two models.</p>
<h2>DataTypes</h2>
<h3>From netCDF-4 to CDM</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A netCDF-4 <em>Compound</em> is a CDM <em>Structure</em>. Both can be arbitrarily nested.</li>
  <li>A netCDF-4 <em>Enum</em> is a CDM <em>enum1, enum2, </em>or<em> enum4</em> and references a <em>EnumTypedef</em> which holds the (enum, String) map.</li>
  <li>A netCDF-4 <em>Vlen</em> is mapped to a CDM <em>variable length Dimension</em>.</li>
  <li>A netCDF-4 <em>Opaque </em>type  is  a CDM <em>opaque </em>type, but the length of the data cannot be found until you read the data. </li>
  <li>NetCDF-4 signed and unsigned <em>byte, short, int, long</em> are mapped to CDM <em>byte, short, int, long</em>. If unsigned, the attribute <strong>_Unsigned = &quot;true&quot; </strong>is added to the CDM Variable.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>From CDM to netCDF-4</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>A CDM array of Opaque may have a different length for each Opaque object. May have to read to find maximum length, or ???</li>
</ul>
<h2>Type Definitions</h2>
<h3>From netCDF-4 to CDM</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A netCDF-4 <em>Enumeration Type </em>becomes a CDM<em> EnumTypedef</em>.</li>
  <li>All other  netCDF-4 type definitions are repeated for each CDM variable that uses them. The attribute <strong>_Typedef = &quot;<em>typename</em>&quot;</strong><strong> </strong>is added to the CDM Variable, where typename is the name of the netCDF-4 type.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>From CDM to netCDF-4</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>A CDM<em> EnumTypedef</em> becomes a netCDF-4 <em>Enumeration Type.</em></li>
  <li>If a CDM Variable has an attribute <strong>_Typedef = &quot;<em>typename</em>&quot;, </strong>then the Variables' definition is made into a netCDF-4 type.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>In CDM, an attribute type may only be a scalar or 1D array of signed <em>byte, short, int, long, float, double, </em>or<em> String</em>. <strong>ENUMS?</strong></p>
<h3>From netCDF-4 to CDM</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An attribute of <em>compound</em> type in netCDF-4 is <em>flattened</em>, by making each field a seperate attribute, with name <em>attName.fieldName</em> in the CDM. </li>
  <li>If the compound attribute is for a compound variable, and the field name of the attribute matches a field name of the variable, the attribute is added to that field instead of being flattened.</li>
  <li>An attribute of <em>enum</em> type in netCDF-4 becomes a <em>String</em> type in the CDM. <strong>???</strong></li>
  <li>An attribute of <em>opaque</em> type in netCDF-4 becomes a <em>byte</em> type in the CDM.</li>
  <li>An attribute of <em>vlen of type</em> in netCDF-4 becomes an array of <em>type</em> in the CDM.</li>
  <li>An attribute of an unsigned <em>byte, short, int</em> in netCDF-4 is promoted to a signed <em>short, int, or long</em> in the CDM.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>From CDM to netCDF-4</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Attributes on member variables of Structures are made into a compound attribute on the parent Structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><br />
1) char arrays are interpeted as UTF-8 bytes array (Strings) when they are attributes . but data arrays are not, they are run through unsignedToShort() and cast to char. this seems like trouble.</p>
<p>2) nc4 allows arbitrary composition of vlen. cdm tries to map these to a variable length dimension, to get a ragged array, not part of the data type. But Arrays are rectangular, so its a difficult fit. </p>
<p>could define ArrayRagged which maps to C multidim arrays.</p>
<p>its natural to map</p>
<pre> int data(x,y,*) -&gt; int(*) data(x,y)</pre>
<p>but it doesnt generalize well to nested vlens. nc4 solution is to declare each tyepe seperately and chain them:</p>
<pre> int(*) type1;
 type1(*) type2;
 type2 data(x,y);

</pre>
<p>Array.isVariableLength(). IOSP might return ArrayInteger from int data(*). Needs to return ArrayObject for int data(3,*), with Array.isVariableLength() true.</p>
<pre>int(*)     returns ArrayInt
int(3,*)   returns ArrayObject(3) with ArrayInt(*) inside
int (*,3)  returns Array(n,3), whatever n happens to be.
int(3,*,*) returns ArrayObject(3) with ArrayObject(*) inside with ArrayInt(*) inside.
int(*,3,*) returns ArrayObject(n) with ArrayObject(3) inside with ArrayInt(*) inside.
int(*,*,3) returns ArrayObject(n) with ArrayInt(*,3) inside. OR  ArrayObject(n) with ArrayObject(*) with ArrayInt(3) inside.


struct {
  int i1;
  float vf(*);
} s(3);

is like float(3,*) -> ArrayObject(3) with ArrayFloat(*), inside the ArrayStructure.
this is getting out of control
</pre>
<p>3) attributes : n4 can be user defined types, cdm: 1 dim array of primitive or String.</p>
