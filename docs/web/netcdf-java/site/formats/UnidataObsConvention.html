<h1>Unidata  Observation Dataset Conventions</h1>
<p><em>John Caron, Ethan Davis, Robb Kambic</em></p>
<p><em>last updated Apr 04, 2005</em></p>
<p>This document describes a <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/content/software/netcdf/conventions.html">Convention for NetCDF (version 3) files</a> for writing Point, Trajectory, and Station observation data. It  uses the <a href="DataDiscoveryAttConvention.html">NetCDF Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery.</a> Files that follow this conventions can be read by the NetCDF-Java library and the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/">IDV</a> into    the Point, Trajectory, and Station data types of the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/CDM/index.html">Common Data Model</a>.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<h3>Point, Trajectory, and Station   Observation datasets</h3>

<p>An <strong><em>observation</em></strong> is a  collection of measurements at one time and location.  A<em><strong> Point Observation dataset</strong></em> contains observations which are not necessarily related in space or time.  A <em><strong> trajectory </strong></em> is a collection of observations which are  connected along a one dimensional track in space, with time increasing monotonically along the track. A <em><strong> Trajectory Observation dataset</strong></em> contains one or more trajectories. A <em><strong>Station Observation dataset</strong></em> contains time series of observations at named locations called <em><strong>stations</strong></em>. </p>
<h3>Grouping Variables into Structures</h3>
<p>A <em><strong>Structure</strong></em> is a NetCDF Variable that contains other Variables, like a <strong>struct</strong> in C. Structures are a new part of NetCDF, introduced in the NetCDF-Java library, version 2.2 as part of the Common Data Model, and also implemented in the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/content/software/netcdf/netcdf-4/index.html">NetCDF-4</a> library. </p>
<p>NetCDF version 3 files can have only one real Structure, namely the <strong><em>record Structure</em></strong> that contains all of the  Variables in the file that use the record (unlimited) dimension. (see <a href="RecordsInNetcdf3.html">Using Records in NetCDF-3 files</a> for a full explanation). However we can also abstractly create a <strong><em>pseudo-Structure</em></strong>, which is a Structure that contains  all the Variables in a  file which have the same outer dimension (the first dimension in C and Java, the last dimension in Fortran). For example, the variables </p>
<pre><strong>   float temperature( record);
   float humidity( record);</strong>
<strong>   char name( record, name_len);</strong>
</pre>
<p>can also be modeled as a Structure : </p>
<pre><strong>   Structure {
     float temperature;
     float humidity;
     char name( name_len);
  } record( record);</strong></pre>
<p>This Convention will use the technique of identifying groups of NetCDF variables through their use of shared dimensions. These groups will effectively be one dimensional Structures with the same name as the defining dimension. Each Structure therefore has a unique index, namely its index in the defining dimension. </p>
<h3>Associating Structures</h3>
<p>Often we need  to associate a list of structures together, and attach them to another structure. For example, we need to identify the list of all observations for a particular station. In this case we call the station the <em><strong>container/parent</strong></em> structure and the observations the <em><strong>contained/child</strong></em> structures. The order of the children is important. Another example is the list of observations for a particular trajectory, especially when there are multiple trajectories in a single file. In that case the order is crucial, since trajectory observations are assumed to be connected along a line in time and space. Given a parent, we want to  find its children efficiently, i.e. not have to read the entire file. </p>
<p>There are three ways that you can create parent-children associations in this Convention.</p>
<p>1. A <em><strong>linked list</strong></em> uses the  index of the children  to create a forward or backward linked list. The parent structure maintains the <strong>first</strong> or <strong>last child</strong> index, and the children structures have a <strong>next</strong> or <strong>previous child</strong> index. The end of the list is indicated by a child index equal to <strong>-1</strong>. The advantage of linked lists is that each parent can have a variable number of children, which can be stored in any order. The variables containing the child indices are determined in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Child structure  variables explicitly named <strong>nextChild </strong>or<strong> prevChild, </strong>and parent Structure variables named <strong>firstChild</strong> or <strong>lastChild</strong>. </li>
  <li>Global attributes <strong>firstChild_variable </strong>and<strong> nextChild_variable</strong> or <strong>lastChild_variable</strong> and <strong>prevChild</strong><strong>_variable</strong>, whose values are the names of the corresponding variables. </li>
</ol>
<p>Each child structure also keeps its parent index in a variable called <strong>parent_index</strong> or named by the <strong>parent_index_variable</strong> attribute. Optionally, each parent keeps track of the number of children in a variable called <strong>numChildren</strong> or named by the <strong>numChildren_variable</strong> attribute. </p>
<p>2. A <em><strong>contiguous list</strong></em> stores the children contiguously in the array, and the parent structures maintain the <strong>first</strong> <strong>child</strong> index and the <strong>number of children</strong>. The the ith parent structure contains children  between <strong>firstChild(i) </strong>and <strong>firstChild(i)</strong> + <strong>numChildren(i) - 1</strong> inclusive.  The advantage of contiguous lists is that each parent can have a variable number of children, and  all the chilren for one parent are stored together on disk for fast access. The variables containing the child indices are determined in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Parent Structure variables explicitly named <strong>firstChild</strong> and <strong>numChildren</strong>.</li>
  <li>Global attributes <strong>firstChild_variable </strong>and<strong> </strong><strong>numChildren</strong><strong>_variable</strong>, whose values are the names of the corresponding variables. </li>
</ol>
<p>Each child structure also keeps its parent index in a variable called <strong>parent_index</strong> or named by the <strong>parent_index_variable</strong> attribute. </p>
<p>3. When each parent has the same number of children (or there is a maximum number of children and you don't mind wasting some space), then you can also use a <em><strong>multidimensional  structure</strong></em>. The parent structure dimension must be the outermost dimension, and the child structure dimension must be the next outer dimension, e.g. the children structure variables would look like <em>float varName( parentDim, childDim). </em>Concrete examples are given below. </p>
<h2>Conventions used by all Observation Datasets</h2>
<h3>Conventions global attribute </h3>
<p>NetCDF files conforming to this specification must add the global attribute: </p>
<pre>  :Conventions = &quot;Unidata Observation Dataset v1.0&quot;; 
</pre>
<p>When following multiple conventions, list them with a comma separator, for example if you conform to both this Convention and one called <em>MyConventions</em>, you would use: </p>
<pre>  :Conventions = &quot;MyConventions, Unidata Observation Dataset v1.0&quot;;
</pre>
<p>Note: The CF-1.0  Convention for observation data is considered incomplete, and we do not recommend using it at this time. <br>
</p>
<h3>Identifying the Observations</h3>
<p>Use the global attribute</p>
<pre><strong>  :observationDimension = &quot;dimName&quot;;</strong></pre>
<p>to name the observation dimension. If there is no such attribute, then the record (unlimited) dimension will be the observation dimension. </p>
<p>An observation is a collection of measurement values at a single time and location. All Variables with the observation dimension.as their outer dimension constitute the  the observation measurement.  The number of observations in the file will then be the length of the observation dimension. <em>(When using multidimensional structures, its more complicated, see examples below) </em></p>
<h3>Identifying the Coordinate Variables </h3>
<p>Each observation must have a latitude, longitude, altitude, and time coordinate value associated with it. There are four ways to do this:</p>
<h4>1. <strong>_Coordinate attributes</strong>:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The latitude variable must have an attribute named <strong>_CoordinateAxisType</strong> with value equal to &quot;Lat&quot;.</li>
  <li>The longitude variable must have an attribute named <strong>_CoordinateAxisType</strong> with value equal to &quot;Lon&quot;.</li>
  <li>The altitude variable must have an attribute named <strong>_CoordinateAxisType</strong> with value equal to &quot;Height&quot;.</li>
  <li>The time variable must have an attribute named <strong>_CoordinateAxisType</strong> with value equal to &quot;Time&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<h4>2. Explicit variable names:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The latitude variable must be named <strong>latitude</strong>.</li>
  <li>The longitude variable must be named <strong>longitude</strong>.</li>
  <li>The altitude variable must be named <strong>altitude</strong> or <strong>depth</strong>.</li>
  <li>The time variable must be named <strong>time</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<h4>3. Global attributes name coordinate variables:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The latitude variable is named by the global attribute <strong>latitude_coordinate.</strong></li>
  <li>The longitude variable is named by the global attribute <strong>longitude_coordinate.</strong></li>
  <li>The altitude variable is named by the global attribute <strong>zaxis_coordinate.</strong></li>
  <li>The time variable is named by the global attribute <strong>time_coordinate.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>4. CF-1 compatible method:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The latitude variable must have <strong>units</strong> attribute &quot;degrees_north&quot;.</li>
  <li>The longitude variable must have <strong>units</strong> attribute &quot;degrees_east&quot;.</li>
  <li>The altitude variable must have the attribute <strong>positive</strong> = &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;.</li>
  <li>The time variable must have <strong>units</strong> attribute that is a udunits date.</li>
  <li>At least one observation variable must have an attribute <strong>coordinates</strong>, whose value is the list of the latitude, longitude, altitude, and time variable names, e.g. <em>varName:coordinates = &quot;latName lonName altName timeName&quot;. </em> To be strictly CF-1 compliant, all observation variables must have the coordinates attribute. The name of the time variable in this list is optional if the time variable is a coordinate variable, but for clarity we recommend putting it in the list. </li>
</ol>
<p>In all  cases:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The latitude variable must be in decimal degrees north (units &quot;degrees_north&quot;). </li>
  <li>The longitude variable must be in decimal degrees east (units &quot;degrees_east&quot;).</li>
  <li>The altitude variable must  be in meters, or have a <strong>units</strong> attribute that is udunits compatible with &quot;meters&quot;. It should have the attribute <strong>positive</strong> = &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;. If missing the positive attribute, &quot;down&quot; will be assumed if the name is depth, and &quot;up&quot; otherwise. Generally it will be assumed to be referenced to mean sea level (msl). Use the long_name attribute to indicate to the user otherwise. </li>
  <li>The time variable must have a <strong>units</strong> attribute that is a udunits date or an ISO 8601 date string. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Optional (but recommended) Information</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Nominal Time</strong>: The time coordinate should be the time of the observation, as exact as possible. Often, there is a nominal time associated with the observation, for example hourly observations have a nominal time on the hour. To indicate this, use an observation variable called  <strong>time_nominal</strong> or named by the <strong>time_nominal_variable</strong> global attribute. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Other  Attributes </h3>
<p>The following are the required attributes  from the set of data discovery attributes defined by <a href="DataDiscoveryAttConvention.html">NetCDF Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery:</a> </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>geospatial_lat_max</strong>: the maximum latitude of any observation. </li>
  <li><strong>geospatial_lat_min</strong>: the minimum latitude of any observation. </li>
  <li><strong>geospatial_lon_max</strong>: the maximum longitude of any observation. </li>
  <li><strong>geospatial_lon_min</strong>: the minimum longitude of any observation. </li>
  <li><strong>time_coverage_start</strong>: the earliest time of any observation ( udunits date or an ISO 8601 date string)</li>
  <li><strong>time_coverage_end: </strong>the latest time of any observation ( udunits date or an ISO 8601 date string)</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, it is recommended that all the attributes defined by that specification be used if possible. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>Point Observation datasets </h2>
<p>The latitude, longitude, altitude, and time variables must either have the observation dimension as their only dimension, or be a scalar variable, in which case their scalar value applies to all the observations.</p>
<p>It must have a global attribute</p>
<pre><strong> :cdm_datatype = &quot;Point&quot;; </strong></pre>
<p>The latitude, longitude,  altitude, and time variables must all be observation variables, i.e. have the observation dimension as their outer dimension.</p>
<p>Example CDL. <br>
</p>
<h2>Trajectory Observation datasets </h2>
<p>If there is only one trajectory in the file, then a Trajectory dataset follows the same rules above as a Point dataset, except that it must have the global attribute</p>
<pre><strong> :cdm_datatype = &quot;Trajectory&quot;; </strong></pre>
<p>If there are multiple trajectories in the same file, then the trajectories are identified through the <strong> trajectory dimension. </strong>Use the global attribute</p>
<pre><strong>  :trajectoryDimension = &quot;dimName&quot;;</strong></pre>
<p>to name the trajectory dimension. If there is no such attribute, then there must be a dimension named <strong>trajectory</strong>.</p>
<p>All Variables with the trajectory dimension.as their outer dimension are considered trajectory Variables, containing information about the trajectory. The number of trajectories in the file will then be the length of the trajectory dimension. </p>
<p>The latitude, longitude, altitude, and time variables must all be observation variables, i.e. have the observation dimension as their outer dimension.<strong></strong> There must also exist a <strong>trajectory id</strong> variable and optionally a <strong>trajectory description</strong> variable. The trajectory ids must be unique within the file. These can be identified in two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Trajectory variables explicitly named <strong>trajectory_id</strong> and <strong>trajectory_description</strong>.</li>
  <li>Global attributes <strong>trajectory_id</strong>, and <strong>trajectory_description</strong> whose values are the names of the trajectory id and trajectory description variables.</li>
</ol>
<p>The observations must be associated with their corresponding trajectory using linked lists, contiguous lists, or multidimensional structures. </p>
<p><strong>Example CDLs:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="TrajectoryCDL.txt">One Trajectory, using CF-1 Conventions </a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Station Observation datasets</h2>
<p>A station observation dataset must have a global attribute</p>
<pre><strong> :cdm_datatype = &quot;Station&quot;; </strong></pre>
<p>A station observation dataset needs another group of variables to describe the station information. Use the global attribute</p>
<pre><strong>  :stationDimension = &quot;dimName&quot;;</strong></pre>
<p>to name the station dimension. If there is no such attribute, then there must be a dimension named <strong>station</strong>.</p>
<p>All Variables with the station dimension.as their outer dimension are  <em><strong>station Variables</strong></em>, containing information about the stations. The latitude, longitude, and altitude variables must all be station variables, i.e. have the station dimension as their outer dimension. In addition, there must exist a <strong>station id</strong> variable and optionally a <strong>station description</strong> variable. The station ids must be unique within the file. These can be identified in two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Station variables explicitly named <strong>station_id</strong> and <strong>station_description</strong>.</li>
  <li>Global attributes <strong>station_id_variable</strong>, and <strong>station_description_variable</strong> whose values are the names of the station id and station description variables.</li>
</ol>
<p>The station dimension will likely never be unlimited, so you may need to guess the maximum stations you need, for instance if you are creating the file from streaming data. In this case, set a variable called <strong>number_stations</strong> (or name it through a global attribute <strong>number_stations_variable</strong>) to the number of stations actually used. If that variable is not present, it will be assumed that all stations are valid. </p>
<p>The observations must be associated with their corresponding station using linked lists, contiguous lists, or multidimensional structures. </p>
