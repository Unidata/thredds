<h2>Structures and Record variables </h2>
<p> A <em><strong>Structure</strong></em> is a NetCDF Variable that contains other Variables, like a <strong>struct</strong> in C. All of the data in a Structure are stored together on disk, so that it should be efficient to read all the data in a Structure in a single read. Structures are a new part of NetCDF, introduced in the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/index.html">NetCDF-Java</a> library, version 2.2 as part of the Common Data Model, and will also be implemented in <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/netcdf-4/index.html">NetCDF-4</a>. </p>
<p>In the NetCDF version 3 data model, <em><strong>Record variables</strong></em> are ones that use the <strong>unlimited dimension</strong> (also known as the <strong>record dimension</strong>), and these are laid out on disk differently than non-record variables. All of the data for one non-record variable is stored contiguously on disk. Record variables, in contrast, are divided up into <strong>records</strong>, and each record contains the data for all record variables for the ith record dimension index. You can append an unlimited number of records to a NetCDF file. </p>
<p>Since  data for  Record variables is stored continguously on disk in this manner, we can think of the records as a Structure containing the Record variables. Our motivation is to efficiently access all of the data in the Record variables for some record, ie use a single read to fetch the ith record. The usefulness of this obviously depends on your data access patterns. If the dominant access pattern is to read all the data for one Variable, then it will be more efficient to store that data continuously, ie make it a non-record Variable. If the data access pattern is to iterator over (for example) time, and read all the data for all Variables for each time step, then using Record variables will be more efficient. Efficiency differences can easily be an order of magnitude for large files. </p>
<p>Another reason to use Record variables is to take advantage of the ability to  append an unlimited number of records. At some cost in complexity, this allows us to create variable length arrays, and collections of variable length arrays, as is shown below. </p>

<h2>Using Structures for Station<a name="Station"></a> Data </h2>
<h3>CDM Station Data </h3>
<p>If you have the full  CDM / NetCDF4 data model, heres a way to express station data, using nested Structures: </p>
<pre>
netcdf C:/data/station.nc {
 
 dimensions:
   nstations = 137;
   

 variables: 

   <strong>Structure</strong> {
    char id(8);
    char description(40); 
    float latitude;
		:units = "degrees_north";
    float longitude;
		:units = "degrees_east";
    int elevation;
		:units = "meters";
      :long_name = &quot;meters above msl&quot;;
      :positive = &quot;up&quot;;
    int numReports;
	
    <strong>Structure</strong> {
      int time_observation;
        :units = "seconds since 1970-01-01 00 UTC"; 
      float obs_data1 ;
      float obs_data2(11);
      int obs_data3;
      int obs_data4(4);
      String obs_data5;
      ...
    } <strong>stationObs(*); 	</strong>
	
  } <strong>station( nstations);</strong>
} 

</pre>

  
<p>This describes an array of <strong>station</strong> Structures, each of which has an <strong>id, description, latitude, longitude, and elevation</strong>, as well as a nested, variable length array of <strong>stationObs</strong> Structures. </p>
<p>The (*) means that each station can have a different length array of stationObs structures. </p>
<h3>NetCDF-3 Station data </h3>
<p>We can get the same functionality in netCDF-3 by making use of the record (unlimited) dimension to create a 1D array of structures. Each variable using the record dimension can be thought of as being a member of that structure. The structures are indexed by the record dimension. </p>
<p>The actual netCDF-3 CDL would look like:</p>

<pre>
netcdf C:/data/station.nc {
 
 dimensions:
<strong>   station = 137;</strong>
   <strong>record = UNLIMITED</strong>;
<strong></strong>   id_len = 8;
   location_len = 40;
   od2_len = 11;
   od4_len = 4;
   
 variables: 

    char id(<strong>station</strong>, id_len);
    char location(<strong>station</strong>, location_len); 
    float latitude(<strong>station</strong>);
    float longitude(<strong>station</strong>);
    int elevation(<strong>station</strong>);
    <strong>int firstStationObs(station);</strong>
    int numReports(<strong>station</strong>);
	
    int time_observation(<strong>record</strong>);
      :units = "seconds since 1970-01-01 00 UTC"; 
    <strong>int nextStationObs(record);</strong>
    float obs_data1(<strong>record</strong>) ;
    float obs_data2(<strong>record</strong>, od2_len);
    int obs_data3(<strong>record</strong>);
    int obs_data4(<strong>record</strong>, od4_len);
    String obs_data5(<strong>record</strong>);
    ...
} 

</pre>
<p>Notice that the station data all uses the dimension <strong><em>station</em></strong>, and the stationObs data all uses the 
unlimited dimension <strong><em>record</em></strong>. The <strong><em>firstStationObs</em></strong> and <strong><em>lastStationObs</em></strong> creates a linked list of 
stationObs for each station. Therefore we can get a list of all the stationObs for a station efficiently, but theres no efficent subsetting of that list.</p>
<p>(Note that in the CDM, we were using anonymous dimensions for some of the dimensions, but
  in netCDF-3 we have to declare all dimensions as shared)</p>
<p>(With  the NetCDF-Java 2.2 library (aka nj22), you can open the file to use record structures by calling <strong>NetcdfFile.setUseRecordStructure(true)</strong> and use <strong>Structure.readStructure(int elem)</strong> to efficiently read one structure at a time). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Using Nested Structures for Sounding<a name="Sounding"></a> Data </h2>
<h3>CDM Station/Sounding Data </h3>
<p>Now lets add the complication that each stationObs has a variable length sounding. In CDM: </p>
<pre>
netcdf C:/data/station.nc {
 
 dimensions:
   nstations = 137;
   

 variables: 

   <strong>Structure</strong> {
    char id(8);
    char location(40); 
    float latitude;
    float longitude;
    int elevation;
    int numReports;
	
    <strong>Structure</strong> {
      int time_observation;
	      :units = "seconds since 1970-01-01 00 UTC"; 
      float obs_data1 ;
      float obs_data2(11);
      ...
	  
      <strong>Structure</strong> {
        int depth;
	        :units = "m"; 
        int obs_data3;
        int obs_data4(4);
        String obs_data5;
		  ...
      } <strong>sounding</strong>(*)

    } <strong>stationObs</strong>(*); 	
	
  } <strong>station</strong>( nstations);
} </pre>


<h3>NetCDF-3 Station/Sounding Data </h3>

To express this in the netCDF-3 model, use the same technique as before, using a dimension to associate the variables in each structure, and using linked lists to 
associate the stationObs with the stations, and the soundings with the stationObs.
<pre>
netcdf C:/data/station.nc {
 
 dimensions:
<strong>   station = 137;
   stationObs = 4700;</strong>
<strong>   record = UNLIMITED;</strong>
<strong></strong>   id_len = 8;
   location_len = 40;
   od2_len = 11;
   od4_len = 4;
      
 variables: 
   char id(<strong>station</strong>, id_len);
   char location(<strong>station</strong>, location_len); 
   float latitude(<strong>station</strong>);
   float longitude(<strong>station</strong>);
   int elevation(<strong>station</strong>);
   int firstStationObs(<strong>station</strong>);
   int numReports(<strong>station</strong>);
	
   int time_observation(<strong>stationObs</strong>);
     :units = "seconds since 1970-01-01 00 UTC"; 
   int nextStationObs(<strong>stationObs</strong>);
   float obs_data1(<strong>stationObs</strong>) ;
   float obs_data2(<strong>stationObs</strong>, od2_len);
   String obs_data5(<strong>stationObs</strong>);
   int firstSounding(<strong>stationObs</strong>);
   ...

   float depth(<strong>record</strong>);
   int nextSounding(<strong>record</strong>);
   int obs_data3(<strong>record</strong>);
   int obs_data4(<strong>record</strong>, od4_len);
   ...
} </pre>



<p>Since we only have one unlimited dimension, we use it for the sounding structures. That means we need to determine the number of stationObs in advance, which may or may not be easy to do. NetCDF-4 would eliminate that need.</p>
<p>This allows us to compactly store the data. Again, we can efficiently get a list of all the stationObs for a station, and all the soundings for a stationObs, but other kinds of subsetting is not efficient. NetCDF-4 would not add anything more to that. </p>
<p>Also, a client needs to understand the above structure to make efficient use of it. The NetCDF-Java 2.2 library is adding additional APIs that would understand the above schema, but you would have to be a Java client to use it. </p>
<p>(Using <strong>NetcdfFile.setUseRecordStructure(true)</strong> as described above would make the soundings into a structure, but not the stationObs. This reflects the actual layout of data in the file, rather than the logical structure we create by assiciating all variables that use a dimension).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Using Structures for Trajectory<a name="Trajectory"></a> Data</h2>
<p>While we're at it, heres one way to store trajectory data in netCDF-3 files. We assume there are a number of different trajectories in the file. Each trajectory is a linked list of record structures, as before. Each record consists of various measurements at a given time and location. </p>
<pre>
netcdf C:/data/trajectory.nc {
 
 dimensions:
<strong>   trajectory = 11;</strong>
<strong>   record = UNLIMITED; </strong>
      
 variables: 
   int firstObs(<strong>trajectory</strong>);
   int numObs(<strong>trajectory</strong>); // not strictly needed
	
   int nextObs(<strong>record</strong>);
   int time_observation(<strong>record</strong>);
     :units = "seconds since 1970-01-01 00 UTC"; 
   float latitude(<strong>record</strong>);
   float longitude(<strong>record</strong>);
   int depth(<strong>record</strong>);

   float obs_data1(<strong>record</strong>);
   int obs_data2(<strong>record</strong>);
   int obs_data3(<strong>record</strong>);
   ...
} </pre>
<p>The likely read access pattern is to access all the data for each trajectory in turn. Then the best storage strategy would be to store the linked list in contiguous records. </p>
