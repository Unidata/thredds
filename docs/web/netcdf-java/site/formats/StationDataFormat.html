<h1>Writing Station Data in netCDF files </h1>
<p><em>Robb Kambic and John Caron</em></p>
<p><em>last updated May 12, 2005</em></p>
<p>After examining the MADIS/AWIPS station files format, we made a few changes to it, in order to use it for Unidata's IDD station data to netCDF decoders (eg metar2nc). The basic idea is to use the record (unlimited) dimension in NetCDF files to add each <em><strong>station observation record</strong></em> as it arrives. <em><strong>Station information</strong></em> like name, lat, lon, etc is kept in non-record variables. A link (record number) to the last station obs record written for each station is kept in the station data. A link to the previously written record for the same station is kept in the record data, as well as the station index. This linked list stucture allows a client to quickly find all the observations for a given station in the file. </p>
<h3>Conventions attribute</h3>
<p>NetCDF files conforming to this spec should add the global attribute: </p>
<pre>  :Conventions = &quot;Unidata Station Format v1.0&quot;; 
</pre>
<h3>Station Variables</h3>
<p>The following are the variables that describe the  stations in the file. These always use the station dimension, not the time (record) dimension. Since you may need to preallocate the stations before you know how many you need, the <strong>num_stations</strong> variable has the number of stations actually used. </p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>int num_stations; </strong>number of stations to use </li>
  <li><strong>char id(station, id_len)</strong>; station id, must be unique</li>
  <li><strong>char location(station, location_len);</strong> station description </li>
  <li><strong>float latitude(station); </strong>latitude in decimal degrees north; can also use double </li>
  <li><strong>float longitude(station) ; </strong>longitude in decimal degrees east; can also use double </li>
  <li><strong>float elevation(station)</strong>; elevation in meters above msl; can also use double </li>
  <li><strong>int lastReport(station); </strong>record number of the last station obs record for the station </li>
  <li><strong>int numReports( station)</strong>; number of station obs records for the station in this file. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Station Observation Record</h3>
<p>For each field in the station observation, create a variable that uses the record (unlimited) dimension. Be sure to add a units and long_name attribute and any other attributes to fully describe the data. You can have any number, type or shape of these variables.</p>
<p>You must also have the following record variables:</p>
<p><strong>Time of the observation:</strong></p>
<pre>  int time_observation(recNum);
    time_observation:long_name = &quot;time of observation&quot;;
    time_observation:units = &quot;seconds since 1970-01-01 00 UTC&quot;;</pre>
<p>The units can be any udunits compatible date unit. You can also use any numeric type. </p>
<p><strong>Previous record link: </strong></p>
<pre>  int prevReport(recNum);
    prevReport:long_name = &quot;record number of the previous record for the same station&quot;;
    prevReport:missing_value = -1;
</pre>
<p>  This variable should contain the record number of the previous record for the same station. If its the first record for the station, it should contain -1.</p>
<p><strong>Station index: </strong></p>
<pre>  int station_index(recNum);
    station_index:long_name = &quot;index of the station for this record&quot;;</pre>
<p> This variable should contain the index of the station for this data record. Using this index, one can look in the Station Variables for  information. </p>
<p><strong>Nominal Time of the observation:</strong></p>
<pre>  int time_nominal(recNum);
    time_nominal:long_name = &quot;time of observation&quot;;
    time_nominal:units = &quot;seconds since 1970-01-01 00 UTC&quot;;
</pre>
<p>Use the same units as the time_observation variable. This field is optional. <br>
</p>
<h3><strong>Other Variables</strong></h3>
<p>You also need to add these variables:</p>
<p><strong>Maximum  and minimum observation time: </strong></p>
<pre>  int maximum_time_observation;
    maximum_time_observation:long_name = &quot;maximum time of observation&quot;;
    maximum_time_observation:units = &quot;seconds since 1970-01-01 00 UTC&quot;;

  int minimum_time_observation;
    minimum_time_observation:long_name = &quot;minimum time of observation&quot;;
    minimum_time_observation:units = &quot;seconds since 1970-01-01 00 UTC&quot;;</pre>
<p>Use the same units as the time_observation variable .</p>
