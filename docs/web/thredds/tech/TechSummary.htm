<h1><b>THREDDS Technical Summary</b></h1>
<h3><b>Overview</b></h3>
<p>THREDDS fundamentally provides middleware services to bridge the gap between 
  data providers and data consumers. We are also involved in developing and enhancing 
  some of the underlying data access software tools, libraries and protocols themselves, 
  as well as influencing how data providers and clients use them.</p>
<p>THREDDS is a key element in support of Unidata 2008 proposal's &quot;<em><strong>Distributed, 
  organized collections of digital material</strong></em>&quot; (endeavor 5), 
  and &quot;<strong><em>Improved data access infrastructure</em></strong>&quot; 
  (endeavor 6).</p>
<h3><b>Accomplishments</b></h3>
<p><b><i>Dataset Inventory Catalogs</i></b> are XML documents that allow a data 
  provider to simply list available on-line datasets. The catalog creator can 
  group datasets into a simple hierarchical classification scheme, which makes 
  a catalog into a &#8220;logical data directory&#8221;. At a minimum, the catalog specifies 
  the &#8220;human readable&#8221; dataset name, and how to access it.  The catalog also provides 
  a place to add arbitrary metadata about the dataset. We are focusing on enhancing 
  selected datasets by adding space and time bounding boxes, standard names, and 
  data type information. Catalogs can be static XML files, or dynamically generated 
  by Web servers to track continuously changing datasets.</p>
<p><b><i>Simple THREDDS Servers</i></b> are data servers that have Dataset Inventory 
  Catalogs associated with them. The primary focus of THREDDS has been developing 
  these servers in collaboration with our data provider partners. Current servers 
  include ones at IRI/LDEO (Columbia), SSEC (Madison), NOAA-CIRES Climate Diagnostics 
  Center, Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, and NCAR.  </p>
<p>The <b><i>THREDDS/IDD Server</i></b> makes much of the real-time data coming 
  in on the Unidata IDD available on a THREDDS server. This includes the NCEP 
  model data, satellite data from NOAAPORT and the Unidata/Wisconsin data streams, 
  NEXRAD Radar, Profiler data from NOAA/FSL, as well as METAR, upper air, buoy, 
  SAO and SHEF hydrology station data. The THREDDS/IDD Server will become part 
  of an enhanced LDM that will be available to the Unidata community of 150 IDD 
  users. </p>
<p>We have worked extensively with OpenDAP/DODS developers, and the next version 
  of <b><i>OpenDAP</i></b><b><i> servers</i></b> will have integrated THREDDS 
  Catalogs. We have also developed the THREDDS<b> <i>OpenDAP</i><i> Aggregation 
  Server</i></b> which is an OpenDAP data server that aggregates OpenDAP datasets, 
  as well as serving netCDF datasets, and has THREDDS catalogs already integrated.  
  This means that the next generation of OpenDAP servers will automatically be 
  THREDDS servers.  The <b><i>Live Access Server</i></b> from NOAA/PMEL is a Web 
  server that provides access and visualization of scientific data. It is currently 
  being modified to provide THREDDS catalogs for its data.</p>
<p>Another key THREDDS component for data providers is the <b><i>Catalog Generator</i></b>, 
  which scans file directories and generates THREDDS catalogs automatically. This 
  is a highly configurable tool that gives users control over the arrangement 
  and naming of their datasets, adding metadata, extracting information from the 
  datasets, etc. The <b><i>Catalog Validator</i></b> provides XML and semantic 
  validation of Catalogs, as well as verification of the datasets themselves. 
</p>
<p>The <b><i>ADDE Cataloger</i></b> is a middleware service that constructs Catalogs 
  for ADDE/Mcidas data servers. It provides &#8220;virtual dataset&#8221; services, 
  for example, a dataset named &#8220;latest&#8221; or &#8220;last 3 hours&#8221;, 
  along with a <i>resolver</i> service to translate a virtual dataset into a list 
  of actual datasets available on the ADDE  server. This level of indirection 
  is important for realtime and very large datasets, in order to provide users 
  with the ability to choose datasets of the right granularity.</p>
<p><b><i>Dataset Query Capability </i></b>XML documents are used by middleware 
  services such as the ADDE Cataloger and the THREDDS/IDD Server to specify compactly 
  what datasets are available from a data server. These allow data providers to 
  specify the set of orthogonal choices (for example: station, field, time) that 
  an end-user should make to select from a large and/or real-time collection of 
  datasets. It allows data clients to know how to present appropriate choices 
  to their users in a user interface, without knowing anything specific about 
  the server.</p>
<p>Catalogs are read by the <b><i>Dataset Searcher</i></b>, which provides a programmatic 
  interface for searching by space and time bounding boxes, standard names, data 
  type and server type. People can also search for datasets through a web interface. 
  This is a prototype system that will be developed further in the future.  </p>
<p>The THREDDS <b><i>Dataset Exporter</i></b> creates &#8220;resource records&#8221; 
  appropriate to add to Digital Libraries such as DLESE, NSDL and GCMD. This prototype 
  system uses special metadata records that are added to the datasets in a catalog, 
  which specify the additional information needed by the DL, such as Dublin Core 
  or DIF formats. The Dataset Exporter uses the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) 
  protocol to send these records into the DLESE and NSDL databases. </p>
<p><b><i>THREDDS clients</i></b> are application programs that know how to read 
  THREDDS Catalogs and know how to read data using some or all of the THREDDS 
  data server types, such as OpenDAP, ADDE, netCDF, etc.  The <b><i>Integrated 
  Data Viewer (IDV)</i></b>, also developed at Unidata, is a full featured analysis 
  program capable of advanced 3D visualization based on the VisAD library. <b><i>VGEE</i></b> 
  is an educational content development system build on top of the IDV. <b><i>New 
  Media Studios</i></b> is another educational content development framework which 
  uses Macromedia Director and IDL, and is now in the process of being made THREDDS 
  capable. The <b><i>THREDDS Data Viewer</i></b> is a tool for debugging data 
  servers and prototyping client software, using the <b><i>Java client library</i></b> 
  user interface components and catalog and data access APIs. </p>
<p>A key to successful use of scientific datasets is providing <i>use </i>metadata, 
  especially <i>georeferencing</i> metadata, which allows client software to manipulate 
  and visualize datasets, and to overlay and compare data from different sources. 
  We have helped develop and promulgate georeferencing metadata conventions for 
  netCDF datasets, such as the <b><i>CF Conventions</i></b> for model data.  We 
  have also developed <b><i>extensions to the netCDF data model</i></b> and implemented 
  libraries which automatically recognize and extract georeferencing information 
  in many of the important netCDF and OpenDAP datasets. </p>
<p>We have also developed extensions to the <b><i>Netcdf</i></b><b><i> Markup 
  Language</i></b> (NcML) that allows metadata to be added, deleted or changed 
  in netCDF and OpenDAP datasets, as well as to subset or aggregate netCDF files. 
  This capability has been added to the OpenDAP aggregation server, providing 
  a powerful tool for third<sup></sup> party metadata augmentation, which is in 
  addition to the ability to add metadata into the Inventory Catalogs.</p>

  </li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="20051018"></a>Status update 10/18/2005 </h3>
<ol>
  <li> <strong>THREDDS Data Server (TDS)</strong>: Release 3.2 was completed and is available for anyone to use. Even number releases (3.2) are stable, odd numbers (3.3) are the development version. </li>
  <li><strong>THREDDS IDD Server: </strong>Much of the IDD datastream data on motherlode is now made available through the TDS, release 3.3.02. Special pqact and corresponding catalogs are now standardized, so others can install a &quot;standard&quot; THREDDS IDD server. </li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="09122005" id="09122005"></a>Status update 09/12/2005 </h3>
<ol>
  <li> <strong>THREDDS Data Server (TDS)</strong>: Most of our time has been spent getting the TDS ready for use. This includes making it secure against web attacks, remote debugging and diagnostics, viewing catalogs via a web browser, and installation and configuration <a href="http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8088/thredds/docs/">documentation</a>. The TDS has an integrated <em>OpenDAP</em> <em>server</em> for subsetted file access, an <em>HTTP server</em> for bulk file access, and an experimental <em>WCS server</em> for gridded data, along with <em>THREDDS catalog services</em>.  The TDS is being tested on Unidata's motherlode server, as well as  LEAD servers and several servers outside of Unidata. </li>
  <li>The <strong>THREDDS/IDD Data Server</strong> integrates the TDS with the LDM, providing &quot;pull&quot; access to the IDD data. Data directories and file names have been standardized, and compatible TDS catalogs and LDM <em>pqact</em> files have been created. This allows us to support a standard TDS/IDD server (and maintain changes as the IDD data streams change) for LDM users who prefer to use a standard configuration.</li>
  <li><strong>Automatic Catalog generation and metadata extraction: </strong>Catalog version 1.0.1 integrates TDS configuration elements into THREDDS catalogs, in order to make TDS configuration as easy and as powerful as possible. We are concentrating on automatically creating dynamic catalogs for the IDD data, as well as the automatic extraction of metadata. This work builds on and will eventually supercede the THREDDS <em>Catalog Generator</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Common Data Model (CDM)  Access</strong>: We added the <em>DORADE Radar</em> formatted files, as well as  improvements to the <em>NIDS, GRIB1</em> and <em>GRIB2</em> readers.We are slowly adding access to all the IDD data, so that these can be served though the TDS. See the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/THREDDS/tech/index.html">nj22 web page</a> for current file types that can be read. We are now working on completing <em>GINI</em> access for the IDD satellite data. </li>
  <li> <strong>GIS/Galeon</strong>: We are using the TDS WCS server to participate in the OGC Galeon experiment, which is experimenting with using NetCDF as one of the recommended data formats for data transport within a WCS server. </li>
  <li> <strong>IDV development</strong>: We are tying  nj22/CDM releases to coincide with IDV releases. IDV version 1.2 is using NetCDF library version 2.2.09. New features in the next release of the IDV will include Grid subsetting, and possibly more integration with THREDDS metadata. </li>
  <li><strong>NetCDF Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery</strong> is a <a href="http://my.unidata.ucar.edu/content/software/netcdf-java/formats/DataDiscoveryAttConvention.html">proposed</a> set of NetCDF attributes, to allow automatic extraction of THREDDS metadata and data discovery in discovery centers like GCMD and DLESE. </li>
  <li><strong>Radar data formats</strong>: We are working with the radar community, including ATD, to investigate and propose a new radar file format, probably using NetCDF-4 files. This will tie into our CDM work on Radial data types. </li>
  <li><strong>NetCDF Tools UI </strong>is  for debugging nj22/CDM file reading and THREDDS data servers. It can be <a href="http://my.unidata.ucar.edu/content/software/netcdf-java/v2.2/webstart/index.html">downloaded</a> via webstart. </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3><a name="03302005"></a>Status update 03/30/2005 </h3>
<ol>
  <li> <strong>THREDDS Data Server</strong><span class="style3">:</span> This merges the THREDDS Catalog Server with the data access capabilities of the NetCDF Java 2.2 library. The goal is to create a 100% Java servlet-based data server. Initially the data serving will be through an integrated OpenDAP server, and an experimental WCS server. We are on the verge of releasing an alpha version of this. It will initially serve out the IDD Data needed in the LEAD project. We will extend it to serve out all of the IDD Data stream.</li>
  <li><strong>Catalog XML 1.1</strong> is currently being developed to integrate directory scanning into the Inventory Dataset Catalog specification. This will use the catalog generation library. The goal is to make data server configuration as easy and powerful as possible.</li>
  <li> <strong>OPeNDAP technology</strong>: We are providing our catalog-generation and configuration code to the next version of OPeNDAP library. We are continuing to work closely with James Gallagher et al to influence the development of the OPeNDAP specification. </li>
  <li> <strong>GIS</strong>: We have an experimental WCS server integrated into the THREDDS Data Server. We are working closely with Martin Daly at CADCORP and Frank Warmerdam, the developer of the GDAL library to ensure interoperability. </li>
  <li><strong>Common Data Model Data Access</strong>: Common Data Model (CDM) is an abstract data model that the NetCDF (Unidata), HDF5 (NCSA) and OpenDAP (University of Rhode Island) developers are working to converge their respective data models towards. This is also intended to be the NetCDF-4 data model. The design of this is mostly stable, and the APIs and implementations in the NetCDF-4 and Java-NetCDF libraries are close to stable. </li>
  <li><strong>CDM Coordinate Systems and Scientific Data Types</strong>: These are higher layer abstractions of the Common Data Model, which provides the semantics needed to convert datasets to other protocols and formats such as those required by GIS systems. The <a href="http://my.unidata.ucar.edu/content/software/netcdf-java/CSObjectModel.html">Coordinate System abstract model</a> is complete, and extensive work is ongoing to identify and map existing datasets and Conventions. A NetCDF <a href="http://my.unidata.ucar.edu/content/software/netcdf-java/CoordinateAttributes2.html">_Coordinate attribute conventions</a> encoding  has been proposed and needs review. The Scientific Data Types layer is still undergoing extensive revisions, and specialized email groups such as for Radar datasets are being formed to provide input. </li>
  <li><strong>NetCDF Java 2.2 (nj22) library</strong>: reads NetCDF, OpenDAP, and HDF5 datasets into the CDM. It provides an "I/O Service Provider" framework for reading other binary formats as if these were NetCDF files. So far we can read  <em>GRIB-1, GRIB-2, NEXRAD level 2, NEXRAD level 3 (NIDS), GINI</em>, and <em>DMSP satellite files</em>. Currently working on <em>DORADE Radar</em> formatted files. The library also provides a framework for parsing well known "attribute conventions" to identify coordinate systems and scientific data types. Most of the work to date has been for gridded data, including <em>ADAS, AWIPS, CF-1, COARDS, CSM, NUWG</em>, and <em>WRF</em>. Current work is focusing on Radar, especially formats used by ATD, as well as station data, including <em>AWIPS</em> and <em>MADIS</em>. The nj22 library is integrated with the THREDDS library to allow metadata in THREDDS catalogs to add missing coordinate system information and other metadata. The library is currently in alpha testing, and should go into beta before summer. </li>
  <li><strong>NetCDF Markup Language (NcML)</strong>, an XML format for netCDF files. New work on NcML has focused on making it a powerful language for augmenting and modifying CDM datasets. The NcML Core and Dataset schemas have been merged into a common"NcML-2.2" schema. NcML Coordinate Systems may be deprecated in favor of using the <em>_Coordinate attribute conventions</em>. NcML can also now be used to define and generate new NetCDF-3 files, like ncgen. This work is still in alpha-testing.</li>
  <li><strong>NetCDF Tools UI </strong>is a continuation of the THREDDS Data Viewer client for debugging NetCDF file reading and THREDDS data servers and testing client-side libraries. It can be <a href="http://my.unidata.ucar.edu/content/software/netcdf-java/v2.2/webstart/index.html">downloaded</a> via webstart. </li>
  <li> <strong>IDV development</strong>: IDV version 1.2 is using NetCDF library version 2.2, and so can take advantage of our framework for identifying and augmenting coordinate systems, as well as reading other file formats such as GRIB. We have worked hard to make sure that the NetCDF library development follows the needs and priorities of the IDV development, and they will continue to be a main driver for our scientific datatype design. </li>

<h3>Status update 10/12/2004<a name="101304" id="101304"></a></h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>Common Data Model </strong></p>
<p>Work is ongoing to develop a &quot;common data model&quot; that can be used  to read THREDDS datasets and automatically extract metadata. This is being prototyped in the NetCDF-Java 2.2 library, and will eventually be adapted into the VisAD data model and used by the IDV. An important aspect of this integration with protocol-specific data models is the ability to augment datasets' &quot;use metadata&quot;  with THREDDS. This will give data providers a powerful reason to use THREDDS catalogs. Eventually it will give us the ability to build data servers that can translate from one data access protocol to another, such as WCS. </p>
<p><img src="images/nj22.png" width="720" height="540"></p>
<p>Work on the CDM includes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Data Access layer. We have an ongoing effort with the NetCDF, OpenDAP and HDF5 development groups to study those 3 data models and agree on how they are the same and how they differ, with an eye towards making them as compatible as possible in future development, including NetCDF-4. </li>
  <li>Data Access layer. We have alpha quality code that reads netCDF-3, HDF5 and OpenDAP into the CDM. We are  currently working on GRIB (version 1 and 2), GINI and DMSP (satellite) to validate the feasibility of this approach. We are targeting file formats where we need local access, eg for case studies or the LEAD project. </li>
  <li>Coordinate Systems: improved access to WRF model output, and working to read ADAS formatted netCDF files. </li>
  <li>Datatypes. Have implemented a &quot;Station&quot; data type to go along with existing &quot;Grid&quot; datatype. We can currently read ADDE station data, as well as MADIS and &quot;Unidata Station format&quot; netCDF files. We can speed up ADDE station access by annotating the THREDDS catalog entry.</li>

<h3>Status update 6/04/2004<a name="060404"></a></h3>
<h4>Catalog 1.0 Specification </h4>
<p>In conjuction with NCAR Community Data Portal Group (Luca Cinquini, Michael Burek), a significant revision of the catalog specification was completed. This created many new tags for &quot;enhanced catalogs&quot;, especially for Digital Library entries.</p>
<h4>DQC Specification 0.3</h4>
<p>A new version of the Dataset Query Capabilities specification was completed, as part of our ongoing collaboration with the OpenDAP developers community. This will allow us to use a DQC as a front end and eventual replacement for the OpenDAP &quot;File Server&quot; functionality. </p>
<h4>Digital Library</h4>
<p>We are now writing DIF and ADN Digital Library entries from enhanced catalogs, and working to incorporate them into GCMD and DLESE discovery centers, respectively. </p>
<h4>My World GIS Client </h4>
<p>The MyWorld client, developed by Danny Edelson and others at the World Watcher Project at Northwestern University, is using the THREDDS UI widgets to access THREDDS catalogs. </p>
<h4>THREDDS Server</h4>
<p>The THREDDS Server is a servlet-based web application that provides verious services, including catalog viewing, validation, generation, as well as subsetting and annotation. The DODS Aggregation Server, Catalog Generator, and IDD Data server applications are now bundled in a single war file for easy installation of the entire suite of THREDDS services. </p>
<h4>THREDDS Clients</h4>
<p>The Client widgets are updated to take advantage of the catalog version 1.0 information. All the Client tools and viewer functionality is being packaged in a single webstart-downloadable application, now called the &quot;THREDDS Toolset&quot;. Part of this is a new application called the &quot;Catalog Enhancer&quot; that allows remote editing of catalogs with a GUI for adding enhanced information to a catalog. </p>

<h3>Status Update 1/27/04</h3>
<h4>OpenDAP coordination </h4>
<p>We met with Peter Cornillon and the OpenDAP developers to develop a strategy 
  for OpenDAP/THREDDS. We agreed to make THREDDS catalogs an automatic part of 
  all OpenDAP servers, eventually replacing the &quot;dods directory&quot; service. 
  We also will investigate using the DQC functionality to replace the OpenDAP 
  &quot;file server&quot; and other functions.</p>
<h4>NCAR Data Portal coordination</h4>
<p>We are working with the NCAR Data Portal to define common metadata attributes 
  for THREDDS catalogs in order to create Dublin Core and DIF (GCMD) digital library 
  records. These will be included in the next version of the THREDDS Catalog specification.</p>
<h4>Web Coverage Service</h4>
<p>With the University of Florence, we developed a prototype OGC Web Coverage 
  Service that serves netCDF files. Ongoing work to use latest WCS 1.0 spec and 
  integrate into THREDDS server.</p>
<h4>Ongoing technical work</h4>
<ul>
  <li> new version of the Catalog specification</li>
  <li> new version of the DQC specification</li>
  <li> new versions of the Catalog and CatalogUI libraries.</li>
  <li> integration of THREDDS UI widgets into the IDV.</li>
  <li> improvements to THREDDS/IDD server.</li>
  <li>making the THREDDS Server package / release easy to install.</li>
