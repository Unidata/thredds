  <hr>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The Netcdf Subset Service is one of the ways that the TDS can serve data. It is an experimental REST protocol for returning subsets of CDM datasets. Currently, only  the service for Gridded Data is mature enough for other users to try. The service for Point Data is still under development, contact us if you are eager to try it on your datasets.</p>
  <p>This documentation is for TDS administrators. If you are a client wanting to access data through the Netcdf Subset Service,  look at <a href="../interfaceSpec/NetcdfSubsetService.html">NetCDF Subset Service Reference.</a></p>
  <h2>Enabling the Netcdf Subset Service in the TDS</h2>
  <p>1. In your configuration catalogs, you must define the service like this: </p>
  <pre>  &lt;service name=&quot;subsetServer&quot; serviceType=&quot;<strong>NetcdfSubset</strong>&quot; base=&quot;<strong>/thredds/ncss/grid/</strong>&quot; suffix=&quot;<strong>/dataset.html</strong>&quot;/&gt;</pre>
  <p>Then as usual, add the service to any datasets that you want served, eg:</p>
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;dataset name="datasetName" ID="datasetID" urlPath="/my/urlPath"&gt; 
       &lt;serviceName&gt;<strong>subsetServer</strong>&lt;/serviceName&gt; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/dataset&gt; </pre>
  <p>Note that the name of the service ( <em>subsetServer</em> in this example) is arbitrary, but the <strong>serviceType </strong>and<strong> base </strong>must be exactly as shown. The <strong>suffix</strong> is currently needed to make the TDS web pages work correctly. </p>
  <p>2. In the <a href="ThreddsConfigXMLFile.html#NetcdfSubsetService">threddsConfig.xml file</a>, enable the NetcdfSubsetService. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Restrictions on what files can be served </h2>
  <p>Only Gridded Data can be served, e.g. model data and non-swath sattelite data. The datasets must be in a format that the CDM can read. To check both of these, open  your file in the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/content/software/netcdf-java/v2.2/webstart/index.html">NetCDF ToolsUI program</a>, using the <em><strong>Grids</strong></em> Tab. Any  fields identified as grids will show up in the top table. To be sure, go into the viewer (click <img src="../images/redraw.jpg" width="35" height="33" align="middle"> to bring up the Viewer, then click <img src="../images/redraw.jpg" width="35" height="33" align="middle"> again to show the data) and make sure the data is displayed correctly. If all that works, then the data should be served correctly by the TDS. </p>
