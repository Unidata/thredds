<h1>TDS Training Workshop Preparations</h1>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<h2>General Prep</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Freeze TDS stable version</li>
  <li>Review TDS Reference and Tutorial documentation
    <ul>
      <li>Set aside a full week a month before the workshop to focus only on docs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Write up evaluation forms</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pre-workshop Email to Participants</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Class will start with Java and Tomcat installation and hardening/securing Tomcat
    <ul>
      <li>If you don't need that section, feel free to arrive later (include link to workshop
        schedule).</li>
      <li>If you are interested in that section, consider reading the install and security sections
        and doing the exercises on your desktop before the class (include links to those sections).</li>
    </ul>.
  </li>
  <li>We will then have a TDS overview presentation. We assume you are familiar with the concepts
    of scientific data access including access and subsetting of remote datasets. I.e., why you
    might want your data to be served by a TDS.</li>
  <li>If you are having any particular TDS problems or have data you're having trouble serving, come
    prepared to talk about it (bring some sample data). We will have time set aside for discussing
    your issues and looking at your data.</li>
