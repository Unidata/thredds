<hr />
<p>A Forecast Model Run Collection (FMRC) is a collection of forecast model output. New to TDS / CDM versions 4.2+, the way to define these collections is with a <strong>featureCollection</strong> element in the TDS.</p>
<p>The file collections are managed with a <a href="FeatureCollections.html">CollectionManager</a>. Datasets are opened as GridDatasets, so that the coordinate system information is available.</p>
<p>Generally, datasets can be broken up by forecast time and/or variable, and the code automatically figures out what everything is. However, one cannot put output from multiple runs in the same file; that is, all the variables in a file are assumed to have a single run time.  </p>
<p>The ToolsUI FMRC tab (4.2) allows you to view internal strurctures of an FMRC.</p>
<h3>Opening an FMRC </h3>
<p>Use static method on ucar.nc2.ft.fmrc.Fmrc: </p>
<p><strong>public static Fmrc open(String collection, Formatter errlog, Formatter debug);</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
   The collection may be one of:
<ol>
   <li><a href="CollectionSpecification.html">collection specification</a> string
  <li><em>catalog</em>:catalogURL
  <li>filename.ncml
</ol>
 <h3>Run Date</h3>
<p>If a dateFormatMark is given, a DateExtractor extracts the rundate from the filename or URL. Otherwise there must be  global attributes <strong>_CoordinateModelBaseDate</strong> or <strong>_CoordinateModelRunDate</strong> inside each dataset. The GRIB IOSP reader automatically adds this global attribute.</p>
<h3>Forecast Date</h3>
<p>Each file is opened as a  GridDataset:</p>
<pre>gds = GridDataset.open( mfile.getPath());
</pre>
<p>and the forecast time coordinates are extracted from the grid coordinate system.</p>
<p>There is no need to specify <strong>forecastModelRunCollection</strong> vs <strong>forecastModelRunSingleCollectionc</strong>, nor <strong>timeUnitsChange</strong>. This is detected automatically.</p>
<h3>Regularize</h3>
<p>If true, then all runs for a given offset hour (from 0Z) are assumed to have the same forecast time coordinates. This obviates the need for the FMRC definition files which previously were used on motherlode. This evens out time coordinates, and compensates for missing forecast times in the IDD feed.</p>
<h3>Persistent Caching</h3>
<p>An <em>fmrInv.xml</em> file is made which records the essential grid information from each file. It is cached in a persistent Berkeley Database (bdb) key/value store, so that it only has to be done the first time the file is accessed in an FMRC. Each collection becomes a seperate bdb database, and each file in the collection is an element in the database, with the filename as the key and the <em>fmrInv.xml </em>as the value. When a collection is scanned, any filenames already in the database are reused. Any new ones are read and added to the database. Any entries in the database that no longer have a filename associated with them are deleted.</p>
<p>ToolsUI collections tab allows you to delete database or individual elements.</p>
