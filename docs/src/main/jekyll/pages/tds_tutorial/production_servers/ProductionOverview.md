## What This Section Covers

This section covers Best practices and recommendations on securing a production TDS/Tomcat server.

 * how to do a basic installation of Tomcat, Java, and the TDS
 * be familiar with the Tomcat directory structure
 * how to configure the Tomcat server
 * how to use the Tomcat manager application

## Why Is Security Important?

Be afraid

Misconfiguration of Tomcat can introduce vulnerabilities in security.
The recommendations in this section should be considered "layers" of security: not completely effective by themselves, but more potent when combined.
The topics covered in this section should not be considered a complete laundry list of security fixes! Please use it as a starting point when securing your server. The ordering of the topics in this section are not a representation of the section importance.
