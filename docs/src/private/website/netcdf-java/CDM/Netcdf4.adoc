= NetCDF-4 and CDM Data Models

== Overview

The CDM data model is close to, but not identical to the
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/workshops/2008/netcdf4/Nc4DataModel.html[NetCDF-4
data model]. When reading netCDF-4 files, one is interested in the
mapping from netCDF-4 to CDM. This mapping is relatively stable. As of
version 4.3, the CDM can write to netCDF-4 files, and one is interested
in the mapping from CDM to netCDF-4. This mapping is still being
developed, eg to give users some control where needed.

NetCDF-4 intentionally supports a simpler data model than HDF5, which
means there are HDF5 files that cannot be converted to netCDF-4. See:
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/faq.html#fv15.

== DataTypes

=== From netCDF-4 to CDM

* A netCDF-4 _Compound_ is a CDM __Structure__. Both can be arbitrarily nested.
The components of the Compound type are called _fields_ in NetCDF-4 and _member variables_ in the CDM.
* A netCDF-4 _Enum_ is a CDM _enum1, enum2,_ or _enum4_ and references a _EnumTypedef_ which holds the (enum, String) map.
* A netCDF-4 _Vlen_ is mapped to a CDM __variable length Dimension__.
* A netCDF-4 _Opaque_ type is a CDM _opaque_ type, but the length of the data cannot be found until you read the data.
* NetCDF-4 signed and unsigned _byte, short, int, long_ are mapped to CDM __byte, short, int, long__.

=== From CDM to netCDF-4

* A CDM array of Opaque may have a different length for each Opaque
object. May have to read to find maximum length.
* A CDM Structure may have member Variables that use shared dimensions.
NetCDF4 / HDF5 does not support shared dimensions in Compound fields.
If writing CDM to netCDF4, the shared dimensions are made private.
* A CDM Structure member Variables may have attributes. NetCDF4 / HDF5
does not support attributes on fields in Compound fields. The CDM uses the
<<Netcdf4CompoundAttributes#,Compound Attribute conventions>> for specifying attributes on compound fields.

=== Type Definitions

* A netCDF-4 _Enumeration Type_ becomes a CDM *_EnumTypedef_*
* All other netCDF-4 type definitions are repeated for each CDM variable that uses them.
* The attribute *__Typedef = "typename"_* is added to the CDM Variable, where _typename_ is the name of the netCDF-4 type.
* When writing to a netcdf-4 file, Variable attributes named *__Typedef_* are used to create a netCDF-4 type, thus preserving
shared type semantics.

== Attributes

In CDM, an attribute type may only be a scalar or 1D array of signed or unsigned _byte, short, int, long, float, double,_ or _String_.
A _char_ type is mapped to a _String_.

In netCDF4, attributes can be of any type, including user-defined.

=== From netCDF-4 to CDM

* An attribute of _compound_ type in netCDF-4 is __flattened__, by making each field a separate attribute,
with name _attName.fieldName_ in the CDM.
* If the compound attribute is for a compound variable, and the field
name of the attribute matches a field name of the variable, the
attribute is added to that field instead of being flattened.
* An attribute of _enum_ type in netCDF-4 becomes a _String_ type in the CDM.
* An attribute of _opaque_ type in netCDF-4 becomes a _byte_ type in the CDM.
* An attribute of _vlen of type_ in netCDF-4 becomes an array of _type_ in the CDM.

=== From CDM to netCDF-4

* Attributes on member variables of Structures are made into a compound attribute on the parent Structure.

== Differences between netCDF4 C and Java libraries when reading netCDF4 files

=== Enum Typedefs

* If there is a enum typedef that is not used by a variable, it will not show up in the enum typedefs.

=== Attributes

* When a variable is chunked, an integer array attribute named
__ChunkSize_ is added to the variable, whose values are the chunk size for each dimension.

=== Creation Order

* The C library preserves the creation order of the Dimensions,
Variables, Groups and Attributes, while the Java library does not.

=== Compound field Types

* in a netCDF4 file, fields in a Compound type may not have shared dimension.

== Differences between netCDF-4 C and Java libraries reading HDF5 files

=== Fixed length Strings with anonymous dimension

* HDF5 object: type = 3 (String) with a dimension.
* C library: turns these into variable length Strings
* Java library: turns these into char arrays, with an anonymous dimension

=== Anonymous dimensions

* Java library: retains anonymous dimensions
* C library: turn into shared dimensions, by matching on the dimension length

=== Time datatype (HDF type 2)

* Java library: turn into a _short, int_ or _long_, depending on the precision
* C library: ignores this type

 
== Internal Notes

. char arrays are interpreted as UTF-8 bytes array (Strings) when they are attributes.
but data arrays are not, they are run through unsignedToShort() and cast to char. this seems like trouble.
. nc4 allows arbitrary composition of vlen.
cdm tries to map these to a variable length dimension, to get a ragged array, not part of the data type.
But Arrays are rectangular, so its a difficult fit.
. attributes : n4 can be user defined types, cdm: 1 dim array of primitive or String. Example:

----
netcdf tst_enums {
  types:
    ubyte enum Bradys {Mike = 8, Carol = 7, Greg = 6, Marsha = 5, Peter = 4, Jan = 3, Bobby = 2, Whats-her-face = 1, Alice = 0} ;

// global attributes:
  Bradys :brady_attribute = Alice, Peter, Mike ;
}

netcdf R:/testdata/netcdf4/nc4/tst_enums.nc {
 types:
  enum Bradys { 'Alice' = 0, 'Whats-her-face' = 1, 'Bobby' = 2, 'Jan' = 3, 'Peter' = 4, 'Marsha' = 5, 'Greg' = 6, 'Carol' = 7, 'Mike' = 8};

 :brady_attribute = "Alice", "Peter", "Mike";
}
