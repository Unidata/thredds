= CDM/CF Differences

{cf}#appendix-grid-mappings[CF]
is a metadata standard for netCDF files. CDM is a data model for many
different data formats, which generally conforms to CF whenever the
two overlap. This documents the differences in metadata interpretation.

== Calendar Date Coordinates

* CF: Variables representing time must always explicitly include the units attribute.
The units attribute takes a string value formatted as per the recommendations in the {cf}#udunits[Udunits package]].
This implies that a time coordinate always has a numeric data type. CF uses udunits as its reference library,
although udunits does not handle non-standard calendars.
* CDM:
** The http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/[joda time library] is used to parse time units, instead of udunits.
This allows the CDM to process the {cf}#calendar[CF calendar attribute].
See <<CalendarDateTime#,CDM Calendar Dates>> for details.
** Also accepts time coordinates as ISO formatted Strings. The variable data type may be String or char.
** An extended date syntax is also supported : "CALENDAR period SINCE reference_date"

=== Default calendar

* CF: For udunits, and therefore for CF, the default calendar is _gregorian_ ("Mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar").
* CDM: the default calendar is _proleptic_gregorian_ (ISO8601 standard). This only matters for dates before 1582.
When a dataset explicitly specifies that it is using CF, however, the default calendar is _gregorian_.

== Coordinate Systems

=== Required use of Lat/Lon Coordinates

* CF: requires that all files include latitude and longitude coordinates.
* CDM: allows the user to decide whether to include 2D lat/lon coordinates when writing netCDF/CF files.
** When the data are on a projection, this requirement implies that 2 dimension lat(y,x) and lon(y,x) must be included in the file.
In some circumstances, for example in extracting a single variable into a separate file, including the 2D lat(y,x) and lon(y,x)
variables can triple the size of the file.
** When the 1D x(x) and y(y) coordinates are also included, along with a
<<../reference/StandardCoordinateTransforms#,standard grid_mapping>> that specifies the projection, the CDM uses the projection
for the Coordinate System layer, and not the lat, lon variables.

=== Units of _false_easting_ and _false_northing_

* CF: _false_easting_ and _false_northing_ attribute values must be in the same units as the x and y projection coordinates.
* CDM: the attribute "units" may be specified on the dummy Coordinate Transform Variable, which overrides the x/y
coordinate units. This is needed when the projection does not have access to the x/y coordinates.

== Discrete Sampling Geometries

* CF: Convention for Discrete Sampling Geometries (aka "point data") were added to CF version 1.6.
* CDM: the implementation has some differences, described <<../reference/FeatureDatasets/CFpointImplement#,here>>.
