= Tutorial: Working with NetcdfDataset

The *ucar.nc2.dataset* classes are an extension to the NetCDF API which
provide support for

* processing standard attributes for scale/offset and missing data
* general and georeferencing coordinate systems
* the NetCDF Markup Language (NcML)
* remote access to OpenDAP, ADDE and THREDDS datasets.

NcML is an XML document format that allows you to create ``virtual'' netCDF datasets, including combining multiple netCDF files into one dataset. A later section of the tutorial explains NcML and how to create virtual datasets.

== Using *_NetcdfDataset.openFile_* to open a NetcdfFile

The preferred way to open a NetcdfFile is through the
*NetcdfDataset.openFile* factory method:

[source,java]
----
  String filename = "http://thredds.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/model/NCEP/GFS/CONUS_80km/GFS_CONUS_80km_20061019_0000.grib1";
  NetcdfFile ncfile = null;
  try {
    ncfile = NetcdfDataset.openFile(filename, null);
    process( ncfile);
  } catch (IOException ioe) {
    log("trying to open " + filename, ioe);
  } finally {
    if (null != ncfile) try {
      ncfile.close();
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
      log("trying to close " + filename, ioe);
    }
  }
----

NetcdfDataset.openFile does the follwing:

* Opens an OPeNDAP remote dataset, if the location is a URL that starts
with *http:* , *dods:* or *dap4:* (version 4.4+)
* Opens a <<../reference/stream/CdmRemote#,CdmRemote>> dataset, if
the location is a URL that starts with *cdmremote:*
* Opens a THREDDS dataset, if the location look like
*thredds:<catalog>#<datasetId>*
* Opens an NcML dataset, if the location ends with *.xml* or *.ncml* ,
or its a URL starting with *ncmdl:* (version 4.4+)
* Otherwise, it calls **NetcdfFile.open**, which handles local file or
<<NetcdfFile.adoc#HTTP,HTTP access>> to any CDM file.

== Using *_NetcdfDataset.openDataset_* to open an enhanced NetcdfDataset

When you want the Netcdf-Java library to deal with missing values and
scale/offset unpacking, and to identify Coordinate Systems, you should
use the *NetcdfDataset.openDataset* factory call, for example:

[source,java]
----
  String filename = "http://thredds.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/model/NCEP/GFS/CONUS_80km/GFS_CONUS_80km_20061019_0000.grib1";
  NetcdfDataset ncd = null;
  try {
    ncd = NetcdfDataset.openDataset(filename);
    process( ncd);
  } catch (IOException ioe) {
    log("trying to open " + filename, ioe);
  } finally {
    if (null != ncd) try {
      ncd.close();
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
      log("trying to close " + filename, ioe);
    }
  }
----

Note that *NetcdfDataset* is a subclass of **NetcdfFile**, and so can be
used wherever a NetcdfFile is used. *NetcdfDataset.openDataset* does the
following:

* Calls **NetcdfDataset.openFile**, and wraps the returned *NetcdfFile*
in a *NetcdfDataset* if necessary.
* It processes missing values and scale/offset attributes, modifying
*Variable* data types if necessary
* It calls the appropriate _Coordinate System Builder_ class to identify
the coordinate systems and populate the Coordinate objects.

== Packed data variables and missing values

When you open a NetcdfDataset in _*enhanced mode*_ (the default), any
Variables that have the attributes *scale_factor* and/or *add_offset*
are considered to be __*packed data Variables*__, whose data should be
converted with the formula:

[source,java]
----
 unpacked_data_value = packed_data_value * scale_factor + add_offset
----

usually the packed data type is byte or short, and the unpacked type is
float or double, so the data type of the packed data Variable is
promoted to float or double.

Missing data is indicated by the **valid_min**, **valid_max**,
**valid_range**, *missing_value* or *_FillValue* attributes. When a
Variable has any of these attributes, the *VariableDS.hasMissing()*
method returns true. You can test for missing values with the
*VariableDS.isMissing( value)* method.

To open a NetcdfDataset in enhanced mode, toggle the enhance button
image:images/enhanceButton.jpg[image] on the ToolsUI Viewer tab to ON.

== Coordinate Systems

NetcdfDataset will try to identify the Coordinate Systems in the dataset
by calling a CoordSystemBuilder class that knows how to interpret the
Conventions for that dataset. The information is placed in Coordinate
objects that follow this abstract model (see the javadoc for the
specifics):

:image:../images/CoordSys.png[image]

To write your Coordinate System Builder, see
<<CoordSysBuilder#,here>>. To see the list of CoordinateBuilder
classes, look at the source code in the *ucar.nc2.dataset.conv* package.

When writing netCDF files, we recommend using the
http://cfconventions.org/[Climate and Forcast (CF) Convention] if
possible. When an IOSP reads in a non-netCDF file, it should choose a
Convention to use to encode the Coordinate Systems.

== Using ToolsUI

You can use ToolsUI *CoordSys* Tab to view the Coordinate Systems that
have been constructed. This consists of 3 tables that show the data
variables, the coordinate systems, and the coordinate axes.

== Advanced Use of NetcdfDataset (version 4.2+)

The following is applicable to version 4 of the Netcdf-Java library.
Netcdf-Java version 2.2 effectively has only two enhance modes, *All*
and **None**.

=== NetcdfDataset.Enhance

The kind of enhancements made when a NetcdfDataset is opened is
described by **NetcdfDataset.Enhance**, an enumerated type with these
possible values:

* *ConvertEnums*: convert enum values to their corresponding Strings.
* *ConvertUnsigned*: reinterpret the bit patterns of any negative values as unsigned.
* *ApplyScaleOffset*: process scale/offset attributes, and automatically convert the data.
* *ConvertMissing*: replace missing data with NaNs, for efficiency.
* *CoordSystems*: add coordinate system information.

When using the *ConvertEnums* enhance mode, Variables of type *enum* are
promoted to String types and data is automatically converted using the
EnumTypedef objects, which are maps of the stored integer values to
String values.

When using the *ConvertUnsigned* enhance mode, data are widened to the next larger integral type. To accommodate the
conversion, the data type of the variable is promoted to the next larger type. Note that this only occurs if the
original data type of the variable is unsigned.

When using the *ApplyScaleOffset* enhance mode, scale and offset
attributes are processed when the dataset is opened, and the data type of
the Variable is promoted if necessary to match the unpacked data type.
Data are automatically converted when read.

When using the *ConvertMissing* enhance mode, missing values are replaced by NaNs, for efficiency. Note that if
the enhanced data type is not _float_ or _double_, this enhancement has no effect.

When using the *CoordSystems* enhance mode, _CoordSysBuilder_ is called
to populate the coordinate system objects in the NetcdfDataset when the
dataset is opened.

The enhancement of a dataset can be controlled by passing in a Set of
Enhance enums to **NetcdfDataset**.openDataset(). The default enhance mode is

[source,java]
----
 Set<Enhance> EnhanceAll = Collections.unmodifiableSet(EnumSet.of(Enhance.ConvertEnums,
        Enhance.ConvertUnsigned, Enhance.ApplyScaleOffset, Enhance.ConvertMissing, Enhance.CoordSystems));
----

and can be changed through
**NetcdfDataset.setDefaultEnhanceMode(Set<Enhance> mode)**.

The simplest factory method, __NetcdfDataset.openDataset( location)__,
uses the __*default enhance mode*__. Other factory methods with a
boolean enhance parameter, such as _NetcdfDataset.openDataset(String
location, boolean enhance, CancelTask cancelTask)_ use the default
enhance mode if _enhance_ is true, and **EnhanceMode**.*None* if
_enhance_ is false. Other classes, such as GridDataset, also use the
default enhance mode.

=== Advanced options when opening

The most general factory method for opening NetcdfDataset allows one to
explicitly set the EnhanceMode:

[source,java]
----
NetcdfDataset openDataset(
        DatasetUrl location, Set<Enhance> enhanceMode, int buffer_size, CancelTask cancelTask, Object spiObject)
----

One can also set the buffer size used for reading data, pass in a
CancelTask object to allow user cancelling, and pass an arbitrary object
to the IOServiceProvider that handles the dataset. These last 3
parameters correspond to the ones in the similar factory method for
NetcdfFile:

[source,java]
----
 NetcdfFile openFile(String location, int buffer_size, CancelTask cancelTask, Object spiObject);
----

=== Caching NetcdfDataset and NetcdfFile

Advanced applications like servers might want to enable the caching of
NetcdfDataset and NetcdfFile objects in memory, for performance. Caching
is safe to use in a multithreaded environment such as a servlet
container like Tomcat. Caching keeps resources such as file handles
open, and so cache sizes should be carefully considered.

To enable caching, you must first call

[source,java]
----
 NetcdfDataset.initNetcdfFileCache(int minElementsInMemory, int maxElementsInMemory, int period);
----

where _minElementsInMemory_ are the number of objects to keep in the
cache when cleaning up, _maxElementsInMemory_ triggers a cleanup if the
cache size goes over it, and _period_ specifies the time in seconds to
do periodic cleanups.

One then calls the **acquireFile**() or *acquireDataset* factory methods
instead of openFile() and openDataset. For example:

[source,java]
----
  NetcdfDataset.initNetcdfFileCache(100,200,15*60); // on application startup
  ...

  NetcdfFile ncfile = null;
  try {
    ncfile = NetcdfDataset.acquireFile(location, cancelTask);
    ...
  } finally {
    if (ncfile != null) ncfile.close();
  }

  ...
  NetcdfDataset.shutdown();  // when terminating the application
----

Note that when done with the file, the close() method is called as
usual. Instead of actually closing the file, it is left in the cache for
subsequent acquiring.

Note also that calling *NetcdfDataset.shutdown* is crucial for
terminating background threads that otherwise can prevent process
termination.
