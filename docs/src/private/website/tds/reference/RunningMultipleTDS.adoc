= Running Multiple TDS in a Single Tomcat Installation

Deploying multiple TDS instances in a single Tomcat container is **NOT
recommended**.

**Note**: A better solution may be to run two Tomcat instances each
running a TDS and then run a proxy server in front of both TDS instances
(see our <<TomcatBehindProxyServer#,Running Tomcat Behind a
Proxy Server>> documentation for more information on proxy
configuration).

'''''

Though we have tried to fix reported problems with a setup that involves
multiple TDS in a single Tomcat instance, we do not ourselves run any
servers in this configuration nor do we thoroughly test this setup.

The main issue:

* The TDS uses the values of certain Java system properties for some
internal and user configurable settings. However, Tomcat does not
support per webapp Java system properties (see
link:#GlobalJavaSystemProperties[below]). This means the settings for
one TDS may interfere with the settings of another TDS running in the
same Tomcat container.

== If You Must …

If you need to run multiple TDS in a single Tomcat instance, there are
several extra steps required Two of the steps are the same for all
version of the TDS:

1.  Change the context path (``/thredds'') of the TDS. This can be done
by changing the name of the thredds.war file. For instance (we’ll use
this example throught this section), changing it to `thredds2.war` will
result in the following:
* The .war file will be unpacked in the
`${tomcat_home}/webapps/thredds2/` directory.
* The main URL for that TDS will be:
`http://server:port/thredds2/catalog.html`
2.  In `${tomcat_home}/webapps/thredds2/WEB-INF/web.xml`, change the
value of the "`ContextPath`" context parameter from "`thredds`" to
"`thredds2`".

The remaining steps depend on the TDS version.

**For TDS 4.1.2 and above**:

1.  In
`${tomcat_home}/webapps/thredds2/WEB-INF/classes/thredds/server/tds.properties`,
change the value of "`tds.content.path`" from "`thredds`" to
"`thredds2`".

**For TDS 4.0 through 4.1.1**:

1.  In `${tomcat_home}/webapps/thredds2/WEB-INF/web.xml`, add the
following:
+
------------------------------------------------
<context-param>
  <param-name>log4jExposeWebAppRoot</param-name>
  <param-value>false</param-value>
</context-param>
    
------------------------------------------------
2.  In
`${tomcat_home}/webapps/thredds2/WEB-INF/classes/thredds/server/tds.properties`,
change the value of "`tds.content.path`" from "`thredds`" to
"`thredds2`".

**For TDS 3.17**:

No extra steps are required for TDS 3.17.

== Web Application Containers and Java System Properties

Some web application containers (like Tomcat) have a single set of Java
system properties that are shared by all webapps deployed in a single
container instance. Other web application containers (like Resin) keep
separate sets of Java system properties for each webapp deployed in a
single container instance.

If you are using a web application container that keeps Java system
properties separate for each webapp deployed, the steps in the above
sections that require editing the TDS default properties file
(``tds.properties'') may instead be handled by setting the values of the
Java system properties. The details of how Java system properties are
set will depend on the particulars of the web application container you
are using.
