= GRIB Feature Collections

== Overview

GRIB Feature Collection Datasets are collections of GRIB records, which contain gridded data, typically from numeric model output.
Because of the complexity of how GRIB data is written and stored, the TDS has developed specialized handling of GRIB datasets called
*_GRIB Feature Collections_*.

* The user specifies the collection of GRIB-1 or GRIB-2 files, and the software turns them into a dataset.
* The indexes, once written, allow fast access and scalability to very large datasets.
* Multiple horizontal domains are supported and placed into separate groups.
* Interval time coordinates are fully supported.

=== Multiple Dataset Collections

When a GRIB Collection contains multiple runtimes, and the valid times (forecast times) overlap, a TwoD time dataset is created.
From that, a Best time dataset is also created.

=== Multiple Groups

When a GRIB Collection contains multiple horizontal domains (i.e. distinct Grid Definition Sections (GDS)),
each domain gets placed into a seperate group (CDM) or Dataset (TDS).

=== Generated URLs

Collection endpoints are of the form:

----
 path/partitionName/groupName
----

where:

. *path* : collection path
. *partitionName* : used to disambiguate multiple dataset types within a collection: *_TwoD* or *Best*
. *groupName* : used only when there are multiple groups (horizontal coordinates): _group name_ or empty


== History

=== Version 4.5

The GRIB Collections framework has been rewritten in CDM version 4.5, in
order to handle large collections efficiently. Some of the new capabilities in version 4.5 are:

* GRIB Collections now keep track of both the *_reference time_* and *_valid time_*.
The collection is *_partitioned_* by reference time.
* A collection with a single reference time will have a single partition
with a single time coordinate.
* A collection with multiple reference times will have partitions for
each reference time, plus a *_PartitionCollection_* that represents the
entire collection. Very large collections should be partitioned by
directory and/or file, creating a tree of partitions.
* A PartitionCollection has two *datasets* (kept in seperate groups),
the *TwoD* and the *Best* dataset.
* The *TwoD* dataset has two time coordinates - reference time (aka run
time) and forecast time (aka valid time), corresponding to FMRC _TwoD_
datasets. The forecast time is two dimensional, corresponding to all the
times available for each reference time.
* The *Best* dataset has a single forecast time coordinate, the same as
4.3 GRIB Collections and FMRC _Best_ datasets. If there are multiple
GRIB records corresponding to the same forecast time, the record with
the smallest offset from its reference time is used.

Implementation notes:

* The featureType attribute is now *_GRIB1_* or *_GRIB2_*.
* For each GRIB file, a _grib index_ is written, named _<grib filename>.gbx9_. 
Once written, this never has to be rewritten.
* For each reference time, a _cdm index_ is written, named _<collection.referenceTime>.ncx2_. 
This occasionally has to be rewritten when new CDM versions are released, or if you modify your GRIB configuration.
* For each PartitionCollection, a _cdm index_ is written named __<collection name>.ncx2__. 
This must be rewritten if any of the collection files change.
* The cdm indexing uses extension *.ncx2*, in order to coexist with
the *.ncx* indexes of previous versions. If you are upgrading to 4.5,
and no longer running earlier versions, remove the *ncx* files (save the *gbx9* files).
* For large collections, especially if they change, the THREDDS Data
Manager (TDM) must be run as a seperate process to update the index
files. Generally it is strongly recommended to run the TDM, and
configure the TDS to only read and never write the indexes.
* Collections in the millions of records are now feasible. Java 7 NIO2
package is used to efficiently scan directories.

=== Version 4.6

The GRIB Collections framework has been rewritten in CDM version 4.6, in
order to handle very large collections efficiently. Oh wait we already
did that in 4.5. Sorry, it wasnt good enough.

* TimePartition can now be set to *directory* (default), *file,* a *time
period*, or *none*. Details <<Partitions#,here>>.
* Multiple reference times are handled more efficiently, eg only one index file typically needs to be written.
* Global attributes promoted to dataset properties in the catalog
* Internal changes:
** Internal memory use has been reduced.
** Runtime objects are now immutable, which makes caching possible.
** RandomAccessFiles are kept in a seperate pool, so they can be cached independent of the Collection objects.

=== Version 5.0

The GRIB Collections framework has been significantly improved in CDM version 5.0, in
order to handle very large collections efficiently.

* Collection index files now use the suffix **ncx4**. These will be
rewritten first time you access the files. The *gbx9* files do NOT need
to be rewritten, which is good because those are the slow ones.
* Defaults
** You no longer need specify the dataFormat or dataType, these are automatically added
** It is recommended to not specify the set of services used, but accept the default set of services.
