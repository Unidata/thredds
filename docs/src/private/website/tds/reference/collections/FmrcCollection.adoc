= FMRC Collections

== Overview

A *_Forecast Model Run Collection (FMRC)_* is a collection of
forecast model runs which can be uniquely identified by the
start of the model run, called the model *_run time_*, (also called
the _analysis time_ or _generating time_ or _reference time_).
Each model run has a series of forecast times. A collection of these
runs therefore has two time coordinates, the run time and the forecast
time. An FMRC creates a 2D time collection dataset, and then creates
various 1D time subsets out of it. See this
https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/presentations/caron/FmrcPoster.pdf[poster]
for a detailed example.

Previously this functionality was provided using _FMRC Aggregation_
through NcML and the _<fmrcDataset>_ element in the TDS configuration
catalog. As of TDS 4.2, that implementation is now deprecated and
*_<featureCollection>_* elements are the correct way to provide this
functionality. As of 4.3, *_one should only serve GRIB files with
featureCollection=GRIB, eg not with FMRC_* Typically, FMRC is is
used for collections of model runs stored in netCDF/CF files.

== Constraints on FMRC

* The component files of the collection must all be recognized as
_*Grid*_ Feature datasets by the CDM software.
* Each component file must have a single reference time.
* The times and variables for a model run can be in a single file or
spread out among multiple files.
* The model runs are assumed to be homogenous, that is, they contain the
same collection of variables and attributes, and they must be on the
same horizontal and vertical grid. The model runs can differ only in
their time and runtime coordinates and the actual data values.

=== **Notes**:

* Its best if the reference time is part of the filename, in a way that
can be extracted with a
<<FeatureCollections#dateExtractor,DateExtractor>>.
* If there is a serviceType=``HTTPServer'' for the Feature Collection,
it is removed from the virtual datasets (all except the _Files_
datasets).
* If an _ID_ attribute is not specified on the **featureCollection**,
the _path_ attribute is used as the ID. This is a preferred idiom.
* Note that for the case when a model run dataset is in a single file,
it __ may be different than the same file as seen through the
corresponding _Files_ dataset, if *regularize* is on. In that case, the
time coordinates will be regularized across all model run datasets in
the collection.
* The FMRC virtual dataset is assembled by examining the Grid Coordinate
Systems of the component files. One can use NcML to fix some problems in
the component files.

== fmrcConfig element

Defines options on feature collections with **featureType**=``FMRC''.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
<fmrcConfig regularize="false" datasetTypes="TwoD Best Files Runs" />
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
<fmrcConfig regularize="false" datasetTypes="Files">
  <bestDataset name="Best_Exclude_Spinup" offsetsGreaterEqual="0"/>
</fmrcConfig>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

where:

1.  **regularize**: If true, then the runs for a given hour (from 0Z)
are assumed to have the same forecast time coordinates. For example, if
you have 4 model runs per day (eg 0, 6, 12, 18Z) and many days of model
runs, then all the 6Z runs for all days will have the same time
coordiantes, etc. This ``regularizes'' time coordinates, and is useful
when there may be missing forecast times, which may result in creating a
new time coordinate. *_Leave this to false unless you really have a
series of runs with uniform offsets._*
2.  **datasetTypes**: list the dataset types that are exposed in the TDS
catalog. The possible values are:
* __TwoD__: dataset with two time dimensions (run time and forecast
time), which contains all the data in the collection.
* __Best__: dataset using the latest model data available for each
possible forecast hour.
* __Files__: each component file of the collection is available
seperately, as in a datasetScan. A ``latest'' file will be added if
there is a ``latest'' Resolver service in the catalog.
* __Runs__: A _*model run dataset*_ contains all the data for one run
time.
* __ConstantForecast__s: A *_constant forecast dataset_* is created from
all the data that have the same forecast time. This kind of dataset has
successively shorter forecasts of the same endpoint.
* _ConstantOffsets:_ A _*constant offset dataset*_ is created from all
the data that have the same offset from the beginning of the run.
3.  **bestDataset**: you can define your own ``best dataset''. This uses
the same algorithm as the Best dataset above, but excludes data based on
its offset hour. In the above example, a Best dataset is created with
offset hours less than 0 excluded.
* **name**: the human visible name of the defined best dataset, must be
unique within the fmrcConfig element. Do not use ``best.ncd'',
``fmrc.ncd'', ``runs'', ``files'', ``forecast'', or ``offset''.
* **offsetsGreaterEqual**: forecast offset hours (forecast time - run
time) less than this value are excluded.

**Notes**:

* If an fmrcConfig element is not present, the default is regularize=
__false__, and datasetTypes= "__TwoD Best Files Run__s". Specifying your
own fmrcConfig completely overrides the datasetTypes default.
* When using FMRC for gridded data that doesnt have 2D times, be sure to
put *regularize* = false (or leave it off).

== Working with FMRC in ToolsUI

The ToolsUI FMRC tab allows you to view internal strurctures of an FMRC.
You can pass it a <<CollectionSpecification#,collection
specification string>> or a file with a *featureCollection* element in
it.

== Working with FMRC in client software

=== Opening an FMRC

Use static method on ucar.nc2.ft.fmrc.Fmrc:

*public static Fmrc open(String collection, Formatter errlog, Formatter
debug);* +

The collection may be one of:

1.  <<CollectionSpecification#,collection specification>> string
2.  __catalog__:catalogURL
3.  filename.ncml

=== Run Date

If a dateFormatMark is given, a DateExtractor extracts the rundate from
the filename or URL. Otherwise there must be global attributes
*_CoordinateModelBaseDate* or *_CoordinateModelRunDate* inside each
dataset. The GRIB IOSP reader automatically adds this global attribute.

=== Forecast Date

Each file is opened as a GridDataset:

-----------------------------------------
gds = GridDataset.open( mfile.getPath());
-----------------------------------------

and the forecast time coordinates are extracted from the grid coordinate
system.

There is no need to specify *forecastModelRunCollection* vs
**forecastModelRunSingleCollectionc**, nor **timeUnitsChange**. This is
detected automatically.

=== Regular

If true, then all runs for a given offset hour (from 0Z) are assumed to
have the same forecast time coordinates. This obviates the need for the
FMRC definition files which previously were used on motherlode. This
evens out time coordinates, and compensates for missing forecast times
in the IDD feed.

== Persistent Caching

An _fmrInv.xml_ file is made which records the essential grid
information from each file. It is cached in a persistent Berkeley
Database (bdb) key/value store, so that it only has to be done the first
time the file is accessed in an FMRC. Each collection becomes a seperate
bdb database, and each file in the collection is an element in the
database, with the filename as the key and the _fmrInv.xml_ as the
value. When a collection is scanned, any filenames already in the
database are reused. Any new ones are read and added to the database.
Any entries in the database that no longer have a filename associated
with them are deleted.

ToolsUI collections tab allows you to delete database or individual
elements.

== Conversion of <datasetFmrc> to <featureCollection>

There is no need to specify *forecastModelRunCollection* vs
**forecastModelRunSingleCollection**, nor **timeUnitsChange**. This is
detected automatically.

Old way:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) <datasetFmrc name="NCEP-GFS-CONUS_80km" collectionType="ForecastModelRuns" harvest="true" path="fmrc/NCEP/GFS/CONUS_80km">
     <metadata inherited="true">
       <documentation type="summary">good stuff</documentation>
     </metadata>

2)   <netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2" enhance="true">
       <aggregation dimName="run" type="forecastModelRunCollection" fmrcDefinition="NCEP-GFS-CONUS_80km.fmrcDefinition.xml" recheckEvery="15 min">
         <scan location="/data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/GFS/CONUS_80km/" suffix=".grib1"
               dateFormatMark="GFS_CONUS_80km_#yyyyMMdd_HHmm" subdirs="true" olderThan="5 min"/>
       </aggregation>
     </netcdf>
3)   <fmrcInventory location="/data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/GFS/CONUS_80km/" suffix=".grib1" fmrcDefinition="NCEP-GFS-CONUS_80km.fmrcDefinition.xml" />
     <addTimeCoverage datasetNameMatchPattern="GFS_CONUS_80km_([0-9]{4})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})_([0-9]{2})00.grib1$"
       startTimeSubstitutionPattern="$1-$2-$3T$4:00:00"
       duration="240 hours"/>
   </datasetFmrc>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  *datasetFmrc* replaced by *featureCollection*
* optional _collectionType=``ForecastModelRuns''_ -> mandatory
_featureType=``FMRC''_
2.  NcML *netcdf* element describing the aggregation is now done by
*collection* element
* *aggregation* __dimName__, __type__, and _fmrcDefinition_ are no
longer needed
* *netcdf* *scan* _location, suffix, subdirs,_ and _dateFormatMark_ are
replaced by *collection* _spec_
3.  *fmrcInventory* and *addTimeCoverage* elements are no longer needed

*Old way:*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<datasetFmrc name="RTOFS Forecast Model Run Collection" path="fmrc/rtofs">
  <netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">

 1) <variable name="mixed_layer_depth">
     <attribute name="long_name" value="mixed_layer_depth @ surface"/>
     <attribute name="units" value="m"/>
    </variable>

   <aggregation dimName="runtime" type="forecastModelRunSingleCollection" timeUnitsChange="true" recheckEvery="10 min">

 2)  <variable name="time">
      <attribute name="units" value="hours since "/>
     </variable>

 3)  <scanFmrc location="c:/rps/cf/rtofs" regExp=".*ofs_atl.*\.grib2$"
       runDateMatcher="#ofs.#yyyyMMdd" forecastOffsetMatcher="HHH#.grb.grib2#" subdirs="true"
       olderThan="10 min"/>
   </aggregation>
  </netcdf>
 </datasetFmrc>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

where:

1.  on the outside of the aggregation, attributes are being
added/modified for the existing variable ``mixed_layer_depth'' __in the
resulting FMRC dataset__.
2.  on the inside of the aggregation, an attribute is being
added/modified for the existing variable ``time'' __for each dataset in
the collection__. Typically you need to do this in order to make the
component files into a gridded dataset.
3.  the collection is defined by a _scanFmrc_ element, creating a
_forecastModelRunSingleCollection_ with one forecast time per file

New way:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   <featureCollection name="NCEP-GFS-CONUS_80km" featureType="FMRC" harvest="true" path="fmrc/NCEP/GFS/CONUS_80km">
     <metadata inherited="true">
       <documentation type="summary">good stuff</documentation>
     </metadata>

1)   <collection spec="/data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/GFS/CONUS_80km/GFS_CONUS_80km_#yyyyMMdd_HHmm#.grib1"
               recheckAfter="15 min"
               olderThan="5 min"/>
2)   <update startup="true" rescan="0 5 3 * * ? *" />
3)   <protoDataset choice="Penultimate" change="0 2 3 * * ? *" />
4)   <fmrcConfig regularize="true" datasetTypes="TwoD Best Files Runs ConstantForecasts ConstantOffsets" />
   </featureCollection>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  *collection spec* element
* *collection* _recheckAfter_ is the same as *aggregation*
_recheckEvery_
* *collection* _olderThan_ is the same as *scan* _olderThan_
2.  *update* (optional) allows control over when the *featureCollection*
is updated
3.  *protoDataset* (optional) allows control over the selection of the
``prototypical'' dataset
4.  *fmrcConfig* (optional) allows control over which FMRC virtual
datasets are made available
