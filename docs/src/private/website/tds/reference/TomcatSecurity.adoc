= Tomcat Security

We believe Tomcat to be secure enough for typical scientific uses. There
are no known security exploits or weaknesses. However, the Internet is a
wild place, and we are not security experts so __caveat emptor__. These
are best practices for running Tomcat.

Also see:

in TDS Tutorial>>

== Run as Unprivileged User

By default, Tomcat runs on port 8080 and therefore does not require root
to run. Its important not to run as root. Create a special user, e.g.
named ``tomcat'', which owns everything under **$\{tomcat_home}**, and
change to that user to run Tomcat. This special user will need
read/write access to *$\{tomcat_home}* and its subdirectories, and read
access to your data directories. __Don’t give the tomcat user any rights
in any other directories__. If your operating system allows it (e.g.
Unix, Linux), you might also not allow the tomcat user to log in,
requiring instead that you log in as yourself, then switch to being the
tomcat user.

== Restrict access to critical files

Make sure that everything under *$\{tomcat_home}/conf/* can be read only
by the tomcat user. Typically you would also give write access to the
tomcat user.

== Use a Firewall

Unless you are on a private network, you need a firewall. A firewall
restricts who is allowed to access network ports. Make the default
setting to disallow all accesses, then enable just the ones that are
needed.

* Port *8080* should have unrestricted access.
* If you are allowing <<RemoteManagement#,remote management>>, you
must also open up port **8443**.
* Tomcat also uses port *8005* to enable shutdown. However, shutdown can
only be run from the same machine as Tomcat is running from. As long as
untrusted users aren’t running on your server machine, you shouldn’t
have to worry about this port being open. However, you might want to
restrict public access to it so hackers aren’t tempted.
* If you are also using Tomcat in conjunction with another web server
like Apache to handle servlet/JSP requests, you need to allow that
server access to port **8009**, but typically that can be restricted to
accesses on the same machine or at least on your subnet. If you are
running Tomcat only standalone (e.g. only running the THREDDS data
server) then disable port 8009 in *$\{tomcat_home}/conf/server.xml
file.*

== Remove Default Tomcat Applications

Tomcat ships with several default web applications, found in the
*$\{tomcat_home}/webapps* directory. These defaults depend on the
version of Tomcat and which installer you use.

* The *ROOT* application contains the server’s main page. Any file that
you add under *$\{tomcat_home}/webapps/ROOT* will be served.
* The *admin* and *manager* applications are used for remote management.
To use these applications, you must add users with roles *admin* and
**manager**, respectively. The applications are then accessible from the
main page, and can be used to add further users, start and stop webapps,
etc. You should restrict the IP addresses that are allowed to run these
applications by editing the files *admin.xml* and *manager.xml* in the
*$\{tomcat_home}/conf/Catalina/localhost/* directory.
* The *servlets-examples* and *jsp-examples* should probably be removed
from a production server, to minimize security exposure. You can do this
from the manager application or by deleting those directories from
**$\{tomcat_home}/webapps**.
* The *tomcat-docs, balancer* and *webdav* applications are probably
harmless, but can also be removed if you want.

== Store Passwords as Digest

The file *$\{tomcat_home}/conf/tomcat-users.xml* stores user names and
passwords. By default the passwords are in clear text, e.g.:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="tdsConfig"/>
  <role rolename="manager"/>
  <role rolename="admin"/>
  <user username="sysadmin" password="yrPassword" roles="manager,admin"/>
  <user username="cataloger" password="myPassword" roles="tdsConfig"/>
</tomcat-users>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Store them instead in digested form. First generate the digest (do this
for each user):

-------------------------------------------------------
  > cd  ${tomcat_home}/bin
  > ./digest.sh -a SHA yrPassword
  > yrPassword:aa01ea2afaae56c2b7da5e25ec18c505e58f12d7
-------------------------------------------------------

If you are using DIGEST authentication, (only needed if you arent using
SSL), then use *`{username}:{realm}:{yrPassword}`* instead of
*`{yrPassword}`* in calculating the digest, for example
**`sysadmin:THREDDS Data Server:yrPassword`**. See
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/realm-howto.html#Digested%20Passwords[this]
for more details.

Then cut and paste the digested passwords into the **tomcat-users.xml**:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="tdsConfig"/>
  <role rolename="manager"/>
  <role rolename="admin"/>
  <user username="sysadmin" password="aa01ea2afaae56c2b7da5e25ec18c505e58f12d7" roles="manager,admin"/>
  <user username="cataloger" password="5413ee24723bba2c5a6ba2d0196c78b3ee4628d1" roles="tdsConfig"/>
</tomcat-users>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then change the *server.xml* file to tell it to use digested passwords,
by adding this <Realm> element to the <Host> element named
**localhost**:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<Host name="localhost" debug="0" appBase="/opt/tomcat/webapps" unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true" 
     xmlValidation="false" xmlNamespaceAware="false">
  <Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.MemoryRealm" digest="SHA" />
  ...
</Host>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Separate User Roles For Restricted Datasets

The _tdsConfig, manager_ and _admin_ roles allow access to secure parts
of Tomcat and TDS. These can only be accessed using HTTPS (TLS), and so
are considered secure. If you are <<RestrictedAccess#,restricting
access to datasets>>, you will also add other users who will have the
*restrictedDatasetUser* role**. _Do not give any of these users
(including yourself!) any of the_ tdsConfig, manager _or_ admin _roles -
keep them strictly separate._** This is because *restrictedDatasetUser*
usage can also use non-HTTPS URLs, and so is vulnerable to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking[session hijacking]. By
keeping the roles separate, you make sure that the worst that can happen
is that someone can download some scientific data they shouldn’t have
access to. +

== Restrict Access to Tomcat Manager Applications

The best way to secure the Tomcat manager and administration webapps is
to restrict the set of IP addresses that can access them. This can be
accomplished by including a RemoteAddrValve
(http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/valve.html#Remote_Address_Filter[Tomcat
docs]) in the Context element of these applications. For instance, to
only allows connections from the localhost (127.0.0.1), i.e., the
machine on which the Tomcat server is running, do the following:

1.  Edit **$\{tomcat_home}/conf/Catalina/localhost/admin.xml**. It will
probably look something like this:
+
---------------------------------------------------------
<Context antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true" />
    
---------------------------------------------------------
+
Change it to include the highlighted line here:
+
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<Context antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true">
    <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve" allow="127\.0\.0\.1"/>
</Context>
    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Edit *$\{tomcat_home}/conf/Catalina/localhost/manager.xml* and add
the same line:
+
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<Context antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true">
    <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve" allow="127\.0\.0\.1"/>
</Context>
    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The value of the *allow* attribute must be a comma separated list
of regular expressions used to match against the remote client’s IP
address. Here are several examples:

* *allow=``128\.117\.140\.62''*
* *allow=``128\.117\.140\.62,128\.117\.140\.63,128\.117\.140\.99''*
* *allow=``128\.117\.140\..*''*

Similarly, you can use the _RemoteHostValve_ to filter by host name.
Again, the value of the *allow* and *deny* attributes must be a comma
separated list of regular expressions which will be used to match
against the remote client’s host name. For instance:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteHostValve" allow=".*\.ucar\.edu"/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Java Security Manager

An additional level of security can be provided by running Tomcat with
the Java Security Manager turned on. This can provide fine-grained
security policies, at the cost of complexity in understanding what
rights are needed to do any useful work, and how to grant them. This is
needed if you allow untrusted servlets or JSPs to execute on your
machine. If you are running just the THREDDS Data Server, you probably
don’t need to deal with this.
