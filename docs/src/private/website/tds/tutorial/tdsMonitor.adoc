= The `TdsMonitor` Tool

== Setting up the `TdsMonitor` tool

The TdsMonitor tool allows you to fetch the TDS log files onto your
local machine, and analyze them locally.

=== Setup

==== Keep in Mind

* Access logs are _tomcat-generated_ and can be found in
`${tomcat_home}/logs/`.
* Servlet logs are generated by the _TDS_ and can be found in
`${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/logs/`.

Make sure you have access logging enabled.

* Open `${tomcat_home}/conf/server.xml` and uncomment the
`AccessLogValve` in the `Host`. Modify the `pattern` attribute as per
these <<TDSMonitoringAndDebugging#access,instructions>>.
* http://localhost:8080/thredds/catalog.html[Browse your installation of
the TDS] to generate some entries in the access logs.

Make sure you have the link:TDSMonitoringAndDebugging#tds[TDS
servlet logging] enabled.

* This is turned on by default in the `log4j.xml` file.

Give yourself the access to the `TdsMonitor` tool.

Modify `${tomcat_home}/conf/tomcat-users.xml` to add a new `role` with
the `rolename` attribute of `tdsMonitor` and add this `role` to your
list of `roles`:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="manager"/>
  <role rolename="tdsConfig"/>
  <role rolename="tdsMonitor"/>
  <user name="admin" password="e5e9fa1ba31ecd1ae84f75caaa474f3a663f05f4"
        roles="manager,tdsConfig,tdsMonitor"/>
</tomcat-users>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Download the `ToolsUI` jar file and start the `TdsMonitor` tool.

Download the
ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf-java/v4.5/toolsUI-4.5.jar[ToolsUI.jar]
file to some convenient place on your local drive.

--------------------------------------------------------------
$ pwd
/home/tds

$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 tds ustaff 26235155 Oct 18 20:44 toolsUI-4.5.jar
--------------------------------------------------------------

Start the `TdsMonitor` program by running the following command:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ java -Xmx4g -classpath toolsUI-4.5.jar thredds.ui.monitor.TdsMonitor
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You should see `TdsMonitor` start:

image:images/tdsMonitorStartup.png[image]

Download the current logs files into the `TdsMonitor` tool.

1.  Type `localhost:8080` into the `server` comboBox
2.  Select all 3 buttons `access logs, server logs`, and `data roots`.
3.  Press `Download`
+
You should get a security challenge:
+
image:images/httpChallenge.png[image]
4.  Type in your username and password.
5.  You should see messages showing up in the text area:

link:images/tdsMonitorDownload.png[image:images/tdsMonitorDownload_small.png[image]]

The files will be stored in `$USER_HOME/tdsMonitor/localhost%3A8080`.
For production servers, you will need to manage the large number of logs
stored here.

The server name will be stored permanently for future use. To remove
unwanted servers, right click inside the `server` comboBox, select
`Delete`, and then click on the server names you want to delete.

== Viewing the Tomcat access logs

Switch to the `AccessLogs` tab, and select` localhost:8080`, which will
make the `Start Date` and `End Date` fields get filled out. Press the
`get logs` button image:images/getlogsButt.png[image], and the logs in
the selected time range are read in:

link:images/AccessLogs.png[image:images/AccessLogs_small.png[image]]

Each log entry in the access logs is a row in the table. You can
rearrange the columns by dragging on the column headers. You can sort by
column by clicking on the column headers.

Select a row, and right click to bring up the context menu. Choose
"`Resend URL`" which takes you to the `UrlDump` screen. Choose "`Get`"
and the URL will be resent to the server, and the results shown in the
text area:

link:images/UrlDump.png[image:images/UrlDump_small.png[image]]

Go to the User tab, and reverse sort by count (click on `count` column
header twice), to see a summary of log access records by IP address.
Press the lookup DNS button image:images/dns.png[image] to do reverse
DNS lookup on the IP address (this is very slow, and you have to scroll
the table to force a refresh).

link:images/Users.png[image:images/Users_small.png[image]]

Select a user, then right click to get the context menu. Select ``User
requests'', which takes you back to the LogTable screen, but only shows
the logs that are from the selected user. Press `show All logs` button
image:images/showAll.png[image] to get back to showing all the logs.

Similarly, the `Service` tab shows the logs summarized by service, and
you can drill down to see the individual access calls for a specific
service.

Similarly, the `DataRoot ` tab shows the logs summarized by data root,
and you can drill down to see the individual access calls for a specific
data root. For this to work correctly, you must have selected
`data roots` in the ManageLogs when downloading. This will
download` the       dataroot file to $USER_HOME/tdsMonitor/localhost%3A8080/roots.txt`.
You should refresh it whenever the data roots change on your server.

Go to the TimeSeries tab:

link:images/timeSeries.png[image:images/timeSeries_small.png[image]]

This gives a summary of activity on your server for the selected time
period, using 5 minute intervals. The total number of requests, total
Mbytes sent, and Average Latency in each 5 minute interval are shown.

== Viewing the TDS servlet logs

The TDS Servlet logs are for debugging and are more low-level than the
access logs. They are also bigger and you will want to be careful about
examining a manageable subset of them at any one time.

Switch to the `ServletLogs` tab, and select` localhost:8080`, which will
make the `Start Date` and `End Date` fields get filled out. Press the
`get logs` button image:images/getlogsButt.png[image], and the logs in
the selected time range are read in:

link:images/ServletLogs.png[image:images/ServletLogs_small.png[image]]

The LogTable shows the raw data. You almost always want to look just at
the Merged logs, by choosing the `Merge` tab. For illustration purposes,
we have switched to a larger set of logs from motherlode server:

link:images/Merge.png[image:images/Merge_small.png[image]]

The top table shows groups of logs which are continuous in their
`reqSeq` numbers, so each group indicates that the TDS web application
(and/or Tomcat) was restarted between the endDate and startDate of the
subsequent group. Select one of these groups to see the logs that are in
that group in the lower table.

As with the access log tables, you can rearrange and sort on the
columns. Reverse sort on the `extra` column (by clicking on it twice) to
show the logs that have extra information. In this example:

link:images/extra.png[image:images/extra_small.png[image]]

Select one of the rows with extra information, and click on it to bring
up the information about that request:

link:images/extraInfo.png[image:images/extraInfo_small.png[image]]

This shows all the information about request 294. The first line shows
the information when the request first arrived at the server:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===================================================================
|2010-11-03T18:14:15 |ISO date/time of the request
|[312059] |msecs since server start
|[294] |request number
|INFO |type of log message
|thredds.server.opendap.OpendapServlet |servlet handling the request
|(174.100.87.24) |IP address

/thredds/dodsC/nexrad/level2/IDD/KCLE/

20101103/Level2_KCLE_20101103_2356.ar2v.dds

 |request path
|===================================================================

The second two lines show warning messages from the IOSP that opened the
file. In general, problems will be recorded here, and there may be times
when Unidata support will ask you to forward this information to them in
order to diagnose issues.

The last line shows the closing message after the request has been
completed:

[cols=",",]
|===================================================================
|2010-11-03T18:14:15 |ISO date/time the request was completed
|[312336] |msecs since server start
|[294] |request number
|INFO |type of log message
|thredds.server.opendap.OpendapServlet |servlet handling the request
|200 |HTTP status return
|-1 |size in bytes of returned content
|227 |total request time in msecs
|===================================================================

In this case, the result was handled successfully (status return 200),
and took 227 msecs. The size is often not known in these logs, indicated
by a -1. As you can see, all of the pertinent information is summarized
in the table row. Looking at the complete information is usually only
done to see what the ``extra'' log messages are.

The `Undone` and `Misc` tabs are used to record messages that don’t have
a proper start and end message, and are generally only useful to TDS
support.
