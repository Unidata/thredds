This section stresses the importance of keeping your software up-to-date.

## Rationale

Running the most current versions of software keeps your environment protected against _known_ security vulnerabilities.
This includes the JDK, Tomcat, the TDS and any other third-party libraries or software you run.

Stay Informed!
Subscribe to announcement lists for Tomcat, the TDS and any other software you deploy, to stay abreast of new versions released due to security issues.

As soon as a security issue is disclosed, potential attackers will begin trying to exploit that vulnerability.
It is important that you upgrade your software before an attacker uses the vulnerability against you.
