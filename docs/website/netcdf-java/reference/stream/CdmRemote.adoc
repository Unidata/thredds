== CDM Remote Protocol (Index space Data Access)

The client sends requests of the form **endpoint?query**. The possible query parameters are:

---------------------------------------------------------------
  'req'=( 'CDL' | 'NcML' | 'header' | 'data')
  'var'=vars
  'deflate'=0..9
where:
  deflate := deflate at specified level
  vars := varspec | varspec[';' varspec]
  varspec := varname[subsetSpec]
  varname := backslash escaped variable name
  subsetSpec := '(' fortran-90 arraySpec ')'

  fortran-90 arraySpec := dim | dim ',' dims
  dim := ':' | slice | start ':' end | start ':' end ':' stride
  slice := INTEGER
  start := INTEGER
  stride := INTEGER
  end := INTEGER
---------------------------------------------------------------

* *endpoint* is the URL of a cdmremote service provided by the THREDDS Data Server (TDS).
* Request parameter values are case-insensitive
* The deflate and var parameters are only used for data requests (req=data)
* Setting deflate requests that the server compress the data at the specified deflate level.
The returned message indicates if this was done or not.

=== Example service requests

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|====
|Request |Response
|\http://server:8080/thredds/cdmremote/data.nc?**req=CDL** | dataset CDL
|\http://server:8080/thredds/cdmremote/data.nc?**req=NcML** | dataset NcML
|\http://server:8080/thredds/cdmremote/data.nc?**req=header** | ncstream header message
|\http://server:8080/thredds/cdmremote/data.nc?**req=data&var=Temp(0:99:10,0:127,:);lat;lon** | ncstream data message
|====

* *CDL* and *NcML* outputs are human-friendly listings of the CDM dataset's _structural metadata_, familiar to users of netCDF.
* The *ncstream header* and *ncstream data* messages are for software consumption only.
* A data request uses the _Section specification_ (same as Fortran-90 array notation) to ask for a subset in index space.
* Variable names are case-sensitive and must be <<../../CDM/Identifiers#cdmremote,backslash-escaped>>

== Client libraries

=== Java

*ucar.nc2.stream.CdmRemote* is a subclass of *NetcdfFile* which provides index subsetting on remote CDM datasets.
*NetcdfDataset.openOrAcquireFile()* sees a _cdmremote:url_ prefix, and instantiates a *CdmRemote* object.
The url must be an endpoint for a cdmremote service.
ToolsUI now preferentially uses cdmremote service when it is available.

* upon opening, *req=header* is called and the NetcdfFile objects are read from the response
* when data is requested, and the data are not already stored locally, then *req=data* is called.
* from the client POV, the dataset is exactly the same as any other *NetcdfFile*.

CDM datasets can also be serialized into ncstream messages and stored in a disk file, and then read as a "normal" netCDF file
by the Netcdf-Java library.
In this sense *ncstream* becomes another format for NetCDF files, alongside netCDF-3 and netCDF-4.

* *CdmRemote.writeToFile()* will serialize an entire remote dataset to a file.
* *ucar.nc2.stream.NcStreamIosp* is a Netcdf-Java IOSP that can read ncstream disk files.

=== Python
