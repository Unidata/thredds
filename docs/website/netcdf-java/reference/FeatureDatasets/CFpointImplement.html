<h2>Short guide to writing files using CF-1.6 Discrete Sampling Features Conventions </h2>

<h3>Step 1: Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>At minimum, you must have a (lat, lon) location and a date / time coordinate for all your data. Some types also require a vertical coordinate (e.g.
    altitude, depth).
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: Which feature type?</h3>

<p>What kind of data do you have:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Point (unconnected) data</strong>: data is located at different, unconnected locations.<strong> <em>Examples: </em></strong><em><strong>earthquake
    data, lightning data.</strong></em></li>
  <li><strong>Time series (station) data</strong>: data is located at named locations, called <em>stations</em>. There can be many stations, and usually for
    each station you have multiple data with different time coordinates. Stations have a unique identifier. <em><strong>Examples: weather station data, fixed
      buoys.</strong></em></li>
  <li><strong>Profile data</strong>: A series of connected observations along a vertical line. Each profile has only one lat, lon coordinate (possibly nominal),
    so that the points along the profile differ only in z coordinate and possibly time coordinate. There can be multiple profiles in the same file, and each
    profile has a unique identifier If you have many profiles with the same lat, lon location, use the Time series Profile type. <em><strong>Examples:
      atmospheric profiles from satellites, moving profilers.</strong></em></li>
  <li><strong>Time series (station) Profile data</strong>: Profile data at fixed locations. This is a combination of Time series type and Profile type, so one
    has time series of Profiles at fixed locations. A file can contain many stations and many time series at each station. <em><strong>Examples: profilers,
      balloon soundings.</strong></em></li>
  <li><strong>Trajectory data</strong>: A series of <em>connected</em> observations along a 1D curve in time and space. There can be multiple trajectories in
    the same file, each with a unique identifier. <em><strong>Examples: aircraft data, drifting buoys.</strong></em></li>
  <li><strong>Trajectory of Profiles</strong>:  a collection of profile<strong> </strong>features which originate along a trajectory. So these are trajectories
    which have profile data (varying with z) at each (lat, lon) location. <em><strong>Examples: ship soundings.</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Step 3: Which representation should I use?</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Point (unconnected) data</strong>: use CF <a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/build/cf-conventions.html#idm43165559776">H.1</a>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Time series (station) data</strong>:

      <li>Each station has different number of coordinates and you want to keep file size as small as possible:
        <ol>
          <li>you have all the data already, and you want to optimize reading all the data for one station: you may use

    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 4: Test a sample file</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Write a test file with some sample data in it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Test in ToolsUI 4.3 (<a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/webstart/netCDFtools.jnlp">webstart link</a>)</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to Feature Types / Point Features Tab</li>
      <li>On the right is a combobox with the feature type choices. Select the correct type (or leave ANY_POINT to let the CDM figure it out).</li>
      <li>Enter the file name or navigate with the FileChooser <img src="../../images/filechooser.png" width="28" height="27" alt=""/></li>
      <li>If it works, the various tables will be filled in - click on a table row to navigate the feature heirarchy. The context menu (right-click) on the
        large table lets you show the data.
      </li>
      <li>This widget is pretty clumsy (sorry - we will improve as soon as the MacArthur money arrives). For point data you have to click the &quot;Get ALL Data&quot;
        button <img src="../../images/getall.png" width="25" height="29" alt=""/> above the right navigation pane.
      </li>
      <li>This essentially tests the CDM ability to read your file. The CDM is a bit more lenient than CF in some ways, and a bit more restrictive in others
        (see below for details).
      </li>
      <li>The <a href="http://cfconventions.org/compliance-checker.html">CF compliance checkers</a> may also help diagnose issues.<br/>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Miscellaneous questions and advice</h3>
<ol>
  <li><em><strong>Should I use the unlimited dimension?</strong></em> This can have a huge impact on performance for large files, because it affects the data
    layout on disk. The answer is: it depends.
    <ul>
      <li>If you have lots of variables at each observation, and you want to optimize the case of getting one or a few variables at all the points, then
        <strong>don't</strong> use the unlimited dimension. This is called <em>column oriented storage</em>.
      </li>
      <li>If you want to optimize the case of getting all or most of the variables at each point, then use the unlimited dimension. This is called <em>row
        oriented storage</em>.
      </li>
      <li>For important, long-lived archives, you should test the performance of each case using the read access pattern that you want to optimize.</li>
      <li>If you don't know, then my prejudice is to use the unlimited dimension. For small datasets (&lt;10 M ?) it is probably not that important.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><em>Should I use coordinate variables or auxiliary coordinate variables?</em></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A coordinate variable is 1D, and has the same name as its dimension, e.g. <em><strong>float time(time).</strong></em> The coordinate values must be
        monotonically increasing or decreasing. There can be no missing values. Use a coordinate variable if those conditions are true.
      </li>
      <li>An auxiliary coordinate variable may have missing values, and is not required to have monotonic, or even unique values. If that's the situation, you
        must use an auxiliary coordinate, e.g.<em><strong> float time(sample).</strong></em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em><strong>What's the reason to include ids for things like trajectories or profiles?</strong></em>
    <ul>
      <li>The &quot;instance&quot; ids allow software like the CDM to efficiently fetch just the data for a named feature, using the id.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em><strong>How big should I make my files? How should I divide the data between files?</strong></em>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have the choice, a fewer number of large files is better than zillions of small files. I would shoot for files in the range 50M - 2 Gbytes.
      </li>
      <li>More important is to divide your files into distinct time ranges, called <em>time partitioned files</em>. This is a natural way to divide earth
        science data. It allows the CDM to serve many files as a single dataset using <em>CDM feature collections</em>. For time partitioned files, if possible,
        put the partitioning date in the filename.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em><strong>Why should I bother to do all this extra work?
  </strong></em>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are publicly funded, you should make your data as accessible to others as possible. This is the minimum &quot;extra work&quot; your peers think
        is needed for them to be able to use your data. And they sincerely thank you!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Differences from CF<a name="Diff" id="Diff"></a></h2>

<h3>9.1 <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Limits on coordinate types</span></h3>

<p>Horizontal coordinates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CF: &quot;In Table 9.1 the spatial coordinates x and y typically refer to longitude and latitude but other horizontal coordinates could also be used (see
    sections 4 and 5.6) &quot;</li>
  <li>CDM: only latitude and longitude are supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vertical coordinates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CDM: vertical coordinate may be height or pressure. Dimensionless Vertical Coordinates are not supported.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Limits on dimension ordering</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CF: &quot;In the multidimensional array representations, data variables have both an instance dimension and an element dimension.  The dimensions may be
    given in any order&quot;</li>
  <li>CDM: the instance dimension must be the outer (slowest varying) dimension</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.4 Attribute featureType is required</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CF: &quot;A global attribute, <strong>featureType</strong>, is required for all Discrete Geometry representations except the orthogonal multidimensional
    array representation, for which it is highly recommended&quot;.
  </li>
  <li>CDM: The global attribute <strong>featureType</strong> is always required. Acceptable aliases are <strong>CF:featureType</strong> and <strong>CF:feature_type</strong>
    .
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5  <strong>Feature instance id variable</strong> is required</h3>
<ul>
  <li> CF: &quot;Where feasible a variable with the attribute <strong>cf_role</strong> should be included.  The only acceptable values of cf_role for Discrete
    Geometry CF data sets are timeseries_id, profile_id, and trajectory_id.   The variable carrying the cf_role attribute may have any data type.  When a
    variable is assigned this attribute, it must provide a unique identifier for each feature instance.&quot;</li>
  <li>CDM: A variable representing the instance id is required, indicated by an attribute named  <strong>cf_role</strong>, which follows all the CF rules above.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes on representations</h2>

<p>In all cases, latitude, longitude, altitude and time coordinates must be recognized in the usual CF way. The altitude coordinate is optional in some of the
  forms.</p>
<p>also see: <a href="CFencodingTable.html">DSG Encoding Table</a></p>
<h3>H.1 Point Data</h3>

<p>In the CDM, point data is recognized by the <strong>featureType = &quot;point&quot;</strong> global attribute. The altitude coordinate is optional. All
  coordinates must have the same dimension, called the <em>obs</em> or <em>sample</em> dimension. All variables with the obs dimension as outer dimension are
  data variables.</p>

<h3>H.2 Time Series Data</h3>

<p>In the CDM, this form is recognized by the <strong>featureType = &quot;timeSeries&quot;</strong> global attribute. The altitude coordinate is optional. </p>

<p>Special station variables are recognized by standard names as given below. For backwards compatibility, the given aliases are allowed.</p>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>
<h3>H.2.1 / H.2.2 Multidimensional Time Series Representation</h3>

<p>The lat, lon and altitude coordinates must have the same dimension, called the <em>station</em> or <em>instance</em> dimension. All variables with the
  station dimension as outer dimension are <em>station variables</em>. The time dimension must be of the form<strong> time(time) </strong>or<strong>
    time(station, time)</strong>, where the time dimension is the <em>obs</em> or <em>sample</em> dimension. All data variables must have the form <strong>data(station,
    time)</strong>.</p>

<p>For compatibility with earlier versions </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ragged_row_count</strong> is an alias for <strong>sample_dimension</strong> standard name</li>
  <li><strong>ragged_row_index</strong> is an alias for <strong>feature_dimension</strong> standard name</li>
  <li>all attributes can optionally be prefixed by &quot;CF:&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>H.2.3. Single time series, including deviations from a nominal fixed spatial location</h3>
The CDM uses the axis attribute to choose the correct coordinate. However, it provides no special handling for the precise coordinates.
<h3>H.2.4. Contiguous ragged array representation of time series</h3>
<table width="373" border="1">
  <tr>
    <th width="145" scope="col">standard</th>
    <th width="212" scope="col">alias</th>

      <div align="center"></div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div align="center"></div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>H.3.5. Indexed ragged array representation of profiles</h3>

<p>Example only shows <em><strong>double time(profile) </strong></em>but <em><strong>double time(obs) </strong></em>is also possible, when the observation
  varies by time.</p>

<h3>H.5.1. Multidimensional array representations of time series profiles</h3>

<p>Specification says &quot;The pressure(i,p,o), temperature(i,p,o), and humidity(i,p,o) data for element o of profile p at station i are associated with the
  coordinate values time(i,p), z(i,p,o), lat(i), and lon(i). Any of the three dimensions could be the netCDF unlimited dimension, if it might be useful to be
  able enlarge it.&quot;</p>

<p>Since CDM currently only allows dimensions to be in the order (station, profile, z), then only the station dimension could be unlimited in the
  multidimensional representation. <br/>
