== Overview

*_Point Feature Datasets_* (also known as _Discrete Sampling Geometry (DSG) datasets_) are collections of Point Features.
Point Feature Datasets contain one or more DsgFeatureCollections:

[source,java]
----
public interface ucar.nc2.ft.FeatureDatasetPoint extends ucar.nc2.ft.FeatureDataset {
  List<DsgFeatureCollection> getPointFeatureCollectionList();
}
----

[source,java]
----
public interface DsgFeatureCollection {
  String getName();
  ucar.nc2.constants.FeatureType getCollectionFeatureType();
  CalendarDateUnit getTimeUnit();
  String getAltUnits();
  CalendarDateRange getCalendarDateRange();
  ucar.unidata.geoloc.LatLonRect getBoundingBox();
  int size();
}
----

Point feature types are arrangements of collections of _Point Features_ (a set of measurements at the same point in space and time), distinguished by the geometry and topology of the collections.
The *_Point Feature Types_* that are implemented are:

.  *Point feature* : one or more parameters measured at one point in time and space.
.  *Station time series feature* : a time-series of data points all at the same location, with varying time.
.  *Profile feature* : a set of data points along a vertical line.
.  *Station Profile feature* : a time-series of profile features at a named location.
.  *Trajectory feature* : a set of data points along a 1D curve in time and space.
.  *Trajectory Profile feature* : a collection of profile features which originate along a trajectory. Also known as a _Section_.

A *PointFeature* is a collection of data taken at a single time and a single place:

[source,java]
----
public interface PointFeature {
  DsgFeatureCollection getFeatureCollection();

  ucar.unidata.geoloc.EarthLocation getLocation();

  double getObservationTime();
  CalendarDate getObservationTimeAsCalendarDate();
  double getNominalTime();
  CalendarDate getNominalTimeAsCalendarDate();
  CalendarDateUnit getTimeUnit();

  ucar.ma2.StructureData getDataAll() throws java.io.IOException;
  ucar.ma2.StructureData getFeatureData() throws java.io.IOException;
}
----

The time can be retrieved as a CalendarDate or as a double in units of _getFeatureCollection().getTimeUnit()_.
The actual time of the data sample is the *observation time*, and is always present.
Some observational systems bin data into standard intervals, in which case there is also a **nominal time**.
When the nominal time is not given in the data, it is usually set to the observational time.
Conversion between time as a double and as a *CalendarDate* is done by _getFeatureCollection().getTimeUnits()_.

When a PointFeature is  part of nested features, _getDataAll()_ will return the data with all of the parent data in
a single StructureData object, while _getFeatureData()_ will return the data at just the innermost feature. See examples below.

The _location_ is returned as:

[source,java]
----
public interface ucar.unidata.geoloc.EarthLocation {
  double getLatitude();
  double getLongitude();
  double getAltitude();
  ucar.unidata.geoloc.LatLonPoint getLatLon();
}
----

The _latitude_ and _longitude_ are required, while the _altitude_ may be missing and if so, is set to __Double.NaN__.
The altitude units (if they exist) can be found from _getFeatureCollection().getAltUnits()_.

The actual data of the observation is contained in a **<<../StructureData#StructureData,ucar.ma2.StructureData>>**, which has a collection of
*StructureMembers* which describe the individual data members**,** along with many convenience routines for extracting the data.

=== PointFeatureCollection

A PointFeatureCollection is a collection of PointFeatures:

[source,java]
----
public interface PointFeatureCollection extends DsgFeatureCollection, Iterable<PointFeature> {

  PointFeatureCollection subset(LatLonRect boundingBox, CalendarDateRange dateRange) throws IOException;
}
----

A *PointFeatureCollection* inherits from *DsgFeatureCollection*, and so has a _name, featureType_, and _timeUnit_.
The _size, boundingBox_, and _dateRange_ may not be known until after iterating through the
collection, that is, actually reading the data.
You can force the discovery of these by calling _ucar.nc2.ft.point.DsgCollectionHelper.calcBounds()_.

A PointFeatureCollection implements _Iterable<PointFeature>_, so can be used in a *_foreach_* block:

[source,java]
----
 for (PointFeature pf : pointFeatureCollection) {
   ...
 }
----

You may subset a PointFeatureCollection with a lat/lon bounding box, and/or a dateRange, for example:

[source,java]
----
CalendarDateRange dateRange = CalendarDateRange.of(start, end);
LatLonRect horizSubset = new LatLonRect(40,-105,10.0,20.0);

// get all the points in that subset
PointFeatureCollection subset = original.subset(horizSubset, dateRange);
for (PointFeature pf : subset) {
    ...
}
----

== Profile Features

A *ProfileFeature* is a collection of *PointFeatures* along a vertical line.

[source,java]
----
public interface ProfileFeature extends PointFeatureCollection, Iterable<PointFeature> {
  LatLonPoint getLatLon();
  CalendarDate getTime(); // nominal
  StructureData getFeatureData() throws IOException;
}
----

*ProfileFeature* extends *PointFeatureCollection* and *DsgFeatureCollection*, so has a _name, altUnit_, etc.
The iteration will return *PointFeatures* that all belong to the same profile, with the same lat/lon point and varying heights.
Each profile will have a nominal time, but there may also be a time associated with each point in the profile that varies.

Since a profile is a *PointFeatureCollection*, it implements _Iterable<PointFeature>_, so you get its data using:

[source,java]
----
 for (PointFeature pf : profile) {
   ...
 }
----

=== ProfileFeatureCollection

A collection of *ProfileFeatures* is a *ProfileFeatureCollection*:

[source,java]
----
public interface ProfileFeatureCollection extends PointFeatureCC, Iterable<ProfileFeature> {
  ProfileFeatureCollection subset(LatLonRect boundingBox) throws IOException;
  ProfileFeatureCollection subset(LatLonRect boundingBox, CalendarDateRange dateRange) throws IOException;
}
----

To read all the data, iterate through each *ProfileFeature* in the collection, then through each *PointFeature* of the *ProfileFeature*:

[source,java]
----
for (ProfileFeature profile : profileFeatureCollection) {
  StructureData profileData = profile.getFeatureData();
  for (PointFeature obs : profile) {
    StructureData obsData = obs.getFeatureData();
    ...
  }
}
----

Data associated with the entire profile will be found in _profile.getFeatureData()_, while the data along the z axis will
be in _obs.getFeatureData()_.

You may *subset* a ProfileFeatureCollection with a lat/lon bounding box, getting back another *ProfileFeatureCollection*.
Typically this is a logical subset, and no data is read until you iterate over the subset:

[source,java]
----
LatLonRect wantBB = new LatLonRect("-60,120,12,20");
ProfileFeatureCollection subset = profileFeatureCollection.subset(wantBB);

// get all the profiles in the specified bounding box
for (ProfileFeature profile : subset) {
  LatLonPoint profileLocation = profile.getLatlon();
  ...
}
----

== Station Time Series Features

A *StationTimeSeriesFeature* is a time series of PointFeatures at a single, named location called a *Station*:

[source,java]
----
public interface StationTimeSeriesFeature extends StationFeature, PointFeatureCollection {
  String getName();
  String getDescription();
  String getWmoId();
  double getLatitude();
  double getLongitude();
  double getAltitude();
  LatLonPoint getLatLon();

  StructureData getFeatureData() throws IOException;

  StationTimeSeriesFeature subset(CalendarDateRange dateRange) throws IOException;
}
----

*StationTimeSeriesFeature* extends *PointFeatureCollection* and *DsgFeatureCollection*, so has a _name, altUnit, timeUnits_, etc.
It also extends *Station* and *EarthLocation* and so has a _description, lat, lon, altitude_ and so on.

An iteration will return *PointFeatures* that all belong to the same station. These may or may not be time-ordered. One can also
subset on _dateRange_:

[source,java]
----
CalendarDateRange dateRange = CalendarDateRange.of(start, end);
PointFeatureCollection subset = stationTimeSeriesCollection.subset(dateRange);
for (PointFeature pointFeature : subset) {
  StructureData allData = pointFeature.getDataAll();
  ...
}
----

The example also shows getting a single *StructureData* that will include the data from both the station and the observation.

=== StationTimeSeriesFeatureCollection

A *StationTimeSeriesFeatureCollection* is a collection of stations with time series data at each:

[source,java]
----
public interface StationTimeSeriesFeatureCollection extends PointFeatureCC, Iterable<StationTimeSeriesFeature> {

  List<StationFeature> getStationFeatures() throws IOException;
  List<StationFeature> getStationFeatures( List<String> stnNames)  throws IOException;
  List<StationFeature> getStationFeatures( ucar.unidata.geoloc.LatLonRect boundingBox) throws IOException;

  StationFeature findStationFeature(String name);
  StationTimeSeriesFeature getStationTimeSeriesFeature(StationFeature s) throws IOException;

  // subsetting
  StationTimeSeriesFeatureCollection subset(List<StationFeature> stations) throws IOException;
  StationTimeSeriesFeatureCollection subset(ucar.unidata.geoloc.LatLonRect boundingBox) throws IOException;
  StationTimeSeriesFeatureCollection subset(List<StationFeature> stns, CalendarDateRange dateRange) throws IOException;
  StationTimeSeriesFeatureCollection subset(LatLonRect boundingBox, CalendarDateRange dateRange) throws IOException;

  PointFeatureCollection flatten(List<String> stations, CalendarDateRange dateRange, List<VariableSimpleIF> varList) throws IOException;
  PointFeatureCollection flatten(LatLonRect llbbox, CalendarDateRange dateRange) throws IOException;
}
----

A *StationTimeSeriesFeatureCollection* is a collection of stations, from which you can get the list of available stations, a bounding box, etc.
You may subset the _station collection_ by passing in a list of station names or a lat/lon bounding box.
You may subset the _timeseries collection_ by passing in a list of stations, a lat/lon bounding box, or a date range.
You may _flatten_ the _timeseries collection, making it into a collection of *PointFeatures*. The flattening may include
subsetting by lat/lon bounding box, and/or a dateRange. Flattening can sometimes improve performance.

To access the data, get a *StationTimeSeriesFeature* for a specified Station, or iterate over all *StationTimeSeriesFeatures* in the
collection:

[source,java]
----
for (StationTimeSeriesFeature timeSeries : stationCollection) {
  StructureData stnData = timeSeries.getFeatureData();
  for (ucar.nc2.ft.PointFeature pointFeature : timeSeries) {
    StructureData obsData = pointFeature.getFeatureData();
    ...
  }
}
----

To get a time series at a particular station:

[source,java]
----
Station stn = stationTimeSeriesCollection.getStation("FXOW");
StationTimeSeriesFeature timeSeries = stationTimeSeriesCollection.getStationFeature(stn);
for (ucar.nc2.ft.PointFeature pointFeature : timeSeries) {
  ...
}
----

To get all *PointFeatures* in a specific area and time range, it can help performance sometimes to
flatten the *StationTimeSeriesCollection*, so that the points can be returned in the order they are
stored, instead of sorting by Station. One can still retrieve the associated station by calling
_stationCollection.getStationFeature(pointFeature)_:

[source,java]
----
LatLonRect bb = new LatLonRect( new LatLonPointImpl(40.0, -105.0),
                                new LatLonPointImpl(42.0, -100.0));
CalendarDateRange dateRange = CalendarDateRange.of(start, end);
PointFeatureCollection points = stnCollection.flatten(bb,dateRange);

for (PointFeature pointFeature : points) {
  StationFeature stationFeature = stnCollection.getStationFeature(pointFeature);
  String stationName = stationFeature.getName();
  ...
}
----

== Station Profile Features

A *StationProfileFeature* is a time series of ProfileFeatures at a single, named location.

[source,java]
----
public interface StationProfileFeature extends StationFeature, PointFeatureCC, Iterable<ProfileFeature> {
  String getName();
  String getDescription();
  String getWmoId();
  double getLatitude();
  double getLongitude();
  double getAltitude();
  StructureData getFeatureData() throws IOException;

  List<CalendarDate> getTimes() throws IOException;
  ProfileFeature getProfileByDate(CalendarDate date) throws IOException;

  StationProfileFeature subset(CalendarDateRange dateRange) throws IOException;
}
----

A *StationProfileFeature* is a time series of profiles at a named location. IT extends *StationFeature*, and so has _name,
description,_ etc. Each profile has a nominal time value, and you can get a list of these, or find a specific profile by time.

You can iterate over the *ProfileFeatures* in the collection, then through all *PointFeatures* of the *ProfileFeature*:

[source,java]
----
for (ucar.nc2.ft.ProfileFeature profile : stationProfileFeature) {
  StructureData profileData = profile.getFeatureData();
  for (ucar.nc2.ft.PointFeature pointFeature : profile) {
    ...
  }
}
----

=== StationProfileFeatureCollection

A *StationProfileFeatureCollection* is a collection of *StationProfileFeature*, ie. multiple stations, each of which has
time series of profiles.

[source,java]
----
public interface StationProfileFeatureCollection extends PointFeatureCCC, Iterable<StationProfileFeature> {

  List<StationFeature> getStationFeatures() throws IOException;
  List<StationFeature> getStationFeatures( List<String> stnNames)  throws IOException;
  List<StationFeature> getStationFeatures( ucar.unidata.geoloc.LatLonRect boundingBox) throws IOException;

  StationFeature findStationFeature(String name);
  StationProfileFeature getStationProfileFeature(StationFeature s) throws IOException;

  // subsetting
  StationProfileFeatureCollection subset(List<StationFeature> stations) throws IOException;
  StationProfileFeatureCollection subset(ucar.unidata.geoloc.LatLonRect boundingBox) throws IOException;
  StationProfileFeatureCollection subset(List<StationFeature> stns, CalendarDateRange dateRange) throws IOException;
  StationProfileFeatureCollection subset(LatLonRect boundingBox, CalendarDateRange dateRange) throws IOException;
}
----

A *StationProfileFeatureCollection* looks much like a *StationTimeSeriesFeatureCollection*, except you have profiles instead of point features.

To run through all the data, iterate through each *StationProfileFeature* in the collection, then through each *ProfileFeature* in the
*StationProfileFeature*, then through each *PointFeature* of the *ProfileFeatures*:

[source,java]
----
for (StationProfileFeature stationProfile : stationProfileFeatureCollection) {
  StructureData stnData = stationProfile.getFeatureData();
  for (ProfileFeature profile : stationProfile) {
    StructureData profileData = profile.getFeatureData();
    for (PointFeature pointFeature : profile) {
      StructureData obsData = pointFeature.getFeatureData();
      ...
    }
  }
}
----

== Trajectory Features

A *TrajectoryFeature* is a connected collection of *PointFeatures* along a line in space and time.

[source,java]
----
public interface TrajectoryFeature extends PointFeatureCollection, Iterable<PointFeature> {
  int size();
  CalendarDateRange getCalendarDateRange();
  ucar.unidata.geoloc.LatLonRect getBoundingBox();
  StructureData getFeatureData() throws IOException;
}
----

*TrajectoryFeature* extends *PointFeatureCollection* and *DsgFeatureCollection*, so has a _name, altUnit_, etc.
The iteration will return *PointFeatures* that all belong to the same trajectory.
Since a trajectory is a *PointFeatureCollection*, it implements _Iterable<PointFeature>_, so you get its data using:

[source,java]
----
 for (PointFeature pf : trajectory) {
   ...
 }
----

=== TrajectoryFeatureCollection

A collection of *TrajectoryFeature*s is a *TrajectoryFeatureCollection*:

[source,java]
----
public interface TrajectoryFeatureCollection extends PointFeatureCC, Iterable<TrajectoryFeature> {
  TrajectoryFeatureCollection subset(LatLonRect boundingBox) throws IOException;
}
----

To read all the data, iterate through each *TrajectoryFeature* in the collection, then through each *PointFeature*:

[source,java]
----
for (TrajectoryFeature traj : trajectoryFeatureCollection) {
  StructureData trajData = traj.getFeatureData();
  for (PointFeature obs : traj) {
    StructureData obsData = obs.getFeatureData();
    ...
  }
}
----

Data associated with the entire trajectory will be found in _traj.getFeatureData()_, while the data along the trajectory will
be in _obs.getFeatureData()_.

You may *subset* a TrajectoryFeatureCollection with a lat/lon bounding box, getting back another *TrajectoryFeatureCollection*.
Typically this is a logical subset, and no data is read until you iterate over the subset:

[source,java]
----
LatLonRect wantBB = new LatLonRect("-60,120,12,20");
TrajectoryFeatureCollection subset = trajectoryFeatureCollection.subset(wantBB);

// get all the profiles in the specified bounding box
for (TrajectoryFeature traj : subset) {
  ...
}
----

== TrajectoryProfileFeature Features

A *TrajectoryProfileFeature* is a time series of profiles along a line is space and time, ie a trajectory.

[source,java]
----
public interface TrajectoryProfileFeature extends PointFeatureCC, Iterable<ProfileFeature> {
  StructureData getFeatureData() throws IOException;
}
----

You can iterate over the *ProfileFeatures* in the collection, then through all *PointFeatures* of the *ProfileFeature*:

[source,java]
----
for (ucar.nc2.ft.ProfileFeature profile : trajProfileFeature) {
  StructureData profileData = profile.getFeatureData();
  for (ucar.nc2.ft.PointFeature pointFeature : profile) {
    ...
  }
}
----

=== TrajectoryProfileFeatureCollection

A *TrajectoryProfileFeatureCollection* is a collection of *TrajectoryProfileFeatures*, ie. multiple trajectories, each of which has a
time series of profiles.

[source,java]
----
public interface TrajectoryProfileFeatureCollection extends PointFeatureCCC, Iterable<StationProfileFeature> {
}
----

To run through all the data, iterate through each *TrajectoryProfileFeatureCollection* in the collection,
then through each *ProfileFeature* in the *StationProfileFeature*, then through each *PointFeature* of the *ProfileFeatures*:

[source,java]
----
for (TrajectoryProfileFeature trajProfile : trajProfileFeatureCollection) {
  StructureData trajData = trajProfile.getFeatureData();
  for (ProfileFeature profile : trajProfile) {
    StructureData profileData = profile.getFeatureData();
    for (PointFeature pointFeature : profile) {
      StructureData obsData = pointFeature.getFeatureData();
      ...
    }
  }
}
----
