= Dataset URLs

The netCDF-Java library can read *datasets* from a variety of sources.
The dataset is named using a Uniform Resource Location (_URL_). This
page summarizes the netCDF-Java API use of URLs.

== ucar.nc2.NetcdfFile.open(String location)

=== 1. Local Files

*NetcdfFile* can work with *local files*, e.g:

* _/usr/share/data/model.nc_
* _file:/usr/share/data/model.nc_
* _file:C:/share/data/model.nc_ (NOTE we advise using forward slashes everywhere, including Windows)
* _data/model.nc_ (relative to the current working directory)

When using a file location that has an embedded ":" char, eg _C:/share/data/model.nc_, its a good idea to add the _file:_ prefix,
to prevent the "C:" from being misinterpreted as a URL schema.

=== 2. Remote Files

*NetcdfFile* can open *HTTP remote files*, <<HTTPservice#,served over HTTP>>, for example:

* _\http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/testdata/mydata1.nc_

The HTTP server must implement the *getRange* header and functionality. Performance will
be strongly affected by file format and the data access pattern.

To disambiguate HTTP remote files from OPeNDAP or other URLS, you can use _httpserver:_ instead of _http:_, eg:

* _httpserver://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/testdata/mydata1.nc_

=== File Types

The local or remote file must be <<formats/FileTypes#,one of the
formats that the netCDF-Java library can read>>. We call this set of
files Common Data Model files, (or _CDM files_ for short), to make
clear that the NetCDF-Java library is not limited to netCDF files.

If the URL ends with a with ".Z", ".zip", ".gzip", ".gz", or
".bz2", the file is assumed to be *_compressed_*. The netCDF-Java
library will uncompress/unzip and write a new file without the suffix,
then read from the uncompressed file. Generally it prefers to place the
uncompressed file in the same directory as the original file. If it does
not have write permission on that directory, it will use the
<<Caching#,cache directory>> defined by *ucar.nc2.util.DiskCache.*

== ucar.nc2.dataset.NetcdfDataset.openFile(String location)

*NetcdfDataset* adds another layer of functionality to the CDM data model, handling other protocols and optionally enhancing
the dataset with Coordinate System information, scale/offset processing, dataset caching, etc.

* _openFile()_ can open the same datasets as *NetcdfFile*, plus those listed below.
* _openDataset()_ calls NetcdfDataset.openFile(), then optionally enhances the dataset.
* _acquireDataset()_ allows dataset objects to be cached in memory for performance.

=== 1. OPeNDAP datasets

NetcdfDataset can open *_OPeNDAP_* datasets, which use a _dods:_ or _http:_ prefix, for example:

* _\http://thredds.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/fmrc/NCEP/GFS/CONUS_95km/files/GFS_CONUS_95km_20070319_0600.grib1_
* _dods://thredds.ucar.edu/thredds/models/NCEP/GFS/Global_5x2p5deg/GFS_Global_5x2p5deg_20070313_1200.nc_

To avoid confusion with remote HTTP files, OPeNDAP URLs may use the _dods:_ prefix. Also note that when passing an
OPeNDAP dataset URL to the netCDF-Java library, do not include any the access suffixes, e.g. _.dods, .ascii, .dds_, etc.

For an _http:_ URL, we make a HEAD request, and if it succeeds and returns a headerÂ with Content-Description="dods-dds"
or "dods_dds", then we open as OPeNDAP. If it fails we try opening as an HTTP remote file. Using the _dods:_ prefix makes it
clear which protocol to use.

=== 2. NcML datasets

NetcdfDataset can open *_NcML_* datasets, which may be local or remote, and must end with a _.xml_ or _.ncml_ suffix, for example:

* _/usr/share/data/model.ncml_
* _file:/usr/share/data/model.ncml_
* _\http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/testdata/mydata1.xml_

Because xml is so widely used, we recommend using the _.ncml_ suffix when possible.

=== 3. THREDDS Datasets

NetcdfDataset can open *_THREDDS_* datasets, which are contained in THREDDS Catalogs. The general form is

  thredds:catalogURL#dataset_id

where _catalogURL_ is the URL of a THREDDS catalog, and _dataset_id_ is the ID of a dataset inside of
that catalog. The _thredds:_ prefix ensures that it is understood as a THREDDS dataset. Examples:

* _thredds:http://localhost:8080/test/addeStationDataset.xml#surfaceHourly_
* _thredds:file:c:/dev/netcdf-java-2.2/test/data/catalog/addeStationDataset.xml#AddeSurfaceData_

In the first case, _\http://localhost:8080/test/addeStationDataset.xml_ must be a catalog containing a dataset with ID _surfaceHourly_.
The second case will open a catalog located at _c:/dev/netcdf-java-2.2/test/data/catalog/addeStationDataset.xml_ and
find the dataset with ID _AddeSurfaceData_.

NetcdfDataset will examine the thredds dataset object and extract the dataset URL, open it and return a NetcdfDataset.
If there are more than one *_dataset access URL_*, it will choose a service that it understands. You can modify the preferred
services by calling _thredds.client.catalog.tools.DataFactory.setPreferAccess()_.
The dataset metadata in the THREDDS catalog may be used to augment the metadata of the NetcdfDataset.

=== 4. THREDDS Resolver Datasets

NetcdfDataset can open *_THREDDS Resolver_* datasets, which have the form

  thredds:resolve:resolverURL

The *_resolverURL_* must return a catalog with a single top level dataset, which is the target dataset. For example:

* _thredds:resolve:http://thredds.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/catalog/model/NCEP/NAM/CONUS_12km/latest.xml_

In this case, _\http://thredds.ucar.edu/thredds/catalog/model/NCEP/NAM/CONUS_12km/latest.xml_
returns a catalog contining the latest dataset in the *NCEP/NAM/CONUS_12km* collection.
NetcdfDataset will read the catalog, extract the THREDDS dataset, and open it as in section 3 above.

=== 5. CdmRemote Datasets

NetcdfDataset can open *_<<stream/CdmRemote#,CDM Remote>>_* datasets, with the form

  cdmremote:cdmRemoteURL

for example

* _cdmremote:http://server:8080/thredds/cdmremote/data.nc_

The *_cdmRemoteURL_* must be an endpoint for a cdmremote web service, which provides index subsetting on remote CDM datasets.

=== 6. DAP4 datasets

NetcdfDataset can open datasets through the *_DAP4_* protocol. The url
should either begin with _dap4:_ or _dap4:http:_. Examples:

* _dap4:http://thredds.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/fmrc/NCEP/GFS/CONUS_95km/files/GFS_CONUS_95km_20070319_0600.grib1_
* _dap4://thredds.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/models/NCEP/GFS/Global_5x2p5deg/GFS_Global_5x2p5deg_20070313_1200.nc_

To avoid confusion with other protocols using HTTP URLs, DAP4 URLs are often converted
to use the _dap4_: prefix. Also note that when passing a DAP4 dataset
URL to the netCDF-Java library, do not include any of the access
suffixes, e.g. __.dmr, .dap, .dst__, etc.

== ucar.nc2.ft.FeatureDatasetFactoryManager.open()

FeatureDatasetFactory creates <<FeatureDatasets/Overview#,Feature Datasets>> for Coverages (Grids),
Discrete Sampling Geometry (Point) Datasets, Radial Datasets, etc. These may be based on
local files, or they may use remote access protocols.

_FeatureDatasetFactoryManager_ can open the same URLs that NetcdfDataset and NetcdfFile can open, plus the following:

=== 1. CdmrFeature Datasets

FeatureDatasetFactoryManager can open *_<<stream/CdmrFeature#,CdmRemote Feature Datasets>>_*, which have the form

  cdmrFeature:cdmrFeatureURL

for example:

*  _cdmrFeature:http://server:8080/thredds/cdmremote/data.nc_

The cdmrFeatureURL must be an endpoint for a cdmrFeature web service, which provides coordinate subsetting on remote
_Feature Type_ datasets.

=== 2. THREDDS Datasets

FeatureDatasetFactoryManager can also open _CdmRemote Feature Datasets_, by passing in a dataset ID in a catalog, exactly as in
_NetcdfDataset.open_ as explained above. The general form is

   thredds:catalogURL#dataset_id

where _catalogURL_ is the URL of a THREDDS catalog, and _dataset_id_ is the ID of a dataset inside of
that catalog. The _thredds:_ prefix ensures that the URL is understood as a THREDDS catalog and dataset. Example:

 * _thredds:http://localhost:8081/thredds/catalog/grib.v5/gfs_2p5deg/catalog.html#grib.v5/gfs_2p5deg/TwoD_

If the dataset has a *cdmrFeature* service, the FeatureDataset will be opened through that service. This can be more efficient
than opening the dataset through the index-based services like _OPeNDAP_ and _cdmremote_.

=== 3. Collection Datasets

FeatureDatasetFactoryManager can open collections of datasets specified with a
<<../../tds/reference/collections/CollectionSpecification#,collection
specification string>>. This has the form

  collection:spec

FeatureDatasetFactoryManager calls _CompositeDatasetFactory.factory(wantFeatureType, spec)_ if found,
which returns a FeatureDataset. Currently only a limited number of Point
Feature types are supported. This is an experimental feature.

== NcML referenced datasets

NcML datasets typically reference other CDM datasets, using the _location_ attribute of the _netcdf_ element, for example:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2" 
     location="file:/dev/netcdf-java-2.2/test/data/example1.nc">
...
----

The location is passed to ucar.nc2.dataset.NetcdfDataset.openFile(), and
so can be any valid CDM dataset location. In addition, an NcML
referenced dataset location can be reletive to the NcML file or the
working directory:

* A relative URL resolved against the NcML location (eg *subdir/mydata.nc*). You must *not* use a _file:_ prefix in this case.
* An absolute file URL with a relative path (eg **file:data/mine.nc**). The file will be opened relative to the working directory.

There are a few subtle differences between using a location in NcML and
passing a location to the NetcdfDataset.openFile() and related methods:

1.  *_In NcML, you MUST always use forward slashes_* in your paths, even when on a Windows machine.
For example: _file:C:/data/mine.nc_. NetcdfFile.open() will accept backslashes on a Windows machine.
2.  In NcML, a relative URL is resolved against the NcML location.
In NetcdfFile.open(), it is interpreted as relative to the working directory.

== NcML scan location

NcML aggregation _*scan*_ elements use the location attribute to specify
which directory to find files in, for example: +

[source,xml]
----
<netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
  <aggregation dimName="time" type="joinExisting">
    <scan location="/data/model/" suffix=".nc" />
  </aggregation>
</netcdf>
----

Allowable forms of the location for the scan directory are:

* _/usr/share/data/_
* _file:/usr/share/data/_
* _file:C:/share/data/model.nc_ *(NOTE we advise using forward slashes everywhere, including Windows)*
* _data/model.nc_ (relative to the NcML directory)
* _file:data/model.nc_ (relative to the current working directory)

When using a directory location that has an embedded ':' char, eg _C:/share/data/model.nc_, its a really good idea to add the _file:_
prefix, to prevent the 'C:' from being misinterpreted as a URI schema.

Note that this is a common mistake:

  <scan location="D:\work\agg" suffix=".nc" />

on a Windows machine will try to scan *D:/work/agg/D:/work/agg* . Use

  <scan location="D:/work/agg" suffix=".nc" />

or better

  <scan location="file:D:/work/agg" suffix=".nc" /> +
