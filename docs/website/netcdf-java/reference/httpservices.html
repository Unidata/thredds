<h2><a name="Intro"><u>Introduction</u></a></h2>
NetCDF-Java clients currently use the
<a href="https://hc.apache.org/">Apache HttpClient Libraries</a>
for communicating with remote servers to obtain data.
Unfortunately, these libraries are under continuous development,
so their APIs are unstable from version to version. In addition,
as of httpclient version 4.3, the libraries have moved to an immutable
object model that makes using them complicated to use.
<p>
In order to provide some API stability and to simplify common use,
the Apache libraries have been wrapped. The wrapping code is in the
<em>ucar.httpservices</em> package.
The new public classes are:
<em>HTTPFactory.java</em>,
<em>HTTPFormBuilder.java</em>,
<em>HTTPSession.java</em>,
<em>HTTPMethod.java</em>,
<em>HTTPMethodStream.java</em>,
and
<em>HTTPException.java</em>.
Additionally, the class <em>ucar.nc2.util.net.HttpClientManager</em>
is closely tied to the <em>ucar.httpservices</em> package.
<p>
This document describes <em>some</em> of the methods for each class.
For a complete description of the API, the javadoc files should be
referenced.
<p>
Note that when the code was switched to using httpclient version 4.5,
the API was changed somewhat to reflect experience with previous versions.
Some methods exist to support Backward compatibility, but are deprecated.

<h3><a name="HTTPSession">HTTPSession and Session Semantics</a></h3>
These class <em>HTTPSession</em> supports a form of <em>session</em>
semantics for Java network access. The notion of session
is loosely tied to the HTTP notion of session.
Specifically, an instance of <em>HTTPSession</em> defines a scope
within which authentication and Http methods (e.g. put, get) operate.
<p>
The primary key for an <em>HTTPsession</em> object is an instance
of <em>AuthScope</em>,
which consists of a host (an ip address or name such as unidata.ucar.edu),
a port number, and a scheme (e.g. "http" or "https").
<p>
Effectively, an <em>AuthScope</em> is intended to map to a specific server
somewhere in the internet. Authentication information (credentials) are
tied to that scope and all http methods (put, get, etc.) operate in the
context of an <em>AuthScope</em>.
<p>
Notes:
<ul>
<li>It is possible to convert a URL to an <em>AuthScope</em> by
taking just the hostname,port, and scheme part of the URL and ignoring the rest.
<li>Once set, it is not possible to change the <em>AuthScope</em>
for an <em>HTTPSession</em> object: it is immutable in this respect.
<li><em>HTTPSession</em> objects do NOT necessarily correspond
to the Http notion of a session (SESSIONID or JSESSIONID). There are
security issues involved with using SESSIONID that have not yet been resolved.
<li>It is impossible to create an <em>HTTPSession</em> object without
specifying an <em>AuthScope</em>.
</ul>

<h4>HTTPSession API</h4>
The primary <em>HTTPSession</em> methods of interest are divided into
two groups: global and instance. The global methods are static methods
of <em>HTTPSession</em> and allow operations that will apply to
all instances of <em>HTTPSession</em>, unless specifically overridden.
The instance methods, as a rule, parallel the global methods, but apply
only to a specific session instance. Some methods can only be specified
globally or per-instance.
<p>
The non authentication related global methods of general interest are as follows.
<ul>
<li><pre>static public void setGlobalUserAgent(String userAgent)</pre>
<li><pre>static public void setGlobalCompression(String compressors)</pre>
As a rule, the only allowable compressors are "gzip" and "deflate".
<li><pre>static public void setMaxRedirects(int n)</pre>
<li><pre>static public void setFollowRedirects(boolean tf)</pre>
</ul>

The non authentication related per-instance methods of general instance are as follows.
<ul>
<li><pre>public void close()</pre>
<em>HTTPSession</em> is AutoCloseable so try-with-resources
can be used.
<li><pre>public void setCompression(String compressors)</pre>
<li><pre>public void removeCompression()</pre>
<li><pre>public void setUserAgent(String agent)</pre>
<li><pre>public void setMaxRedirects(int n)</pre>
<li><pre>public void setFollowRedirects(boolean tf)</pre>
<li><pre>public void clearCookies()</pre>
<li><pre>public List<Cookie> getCookies()</pre>
</ul>

The global and per-instance deprecated methods are as follows.
<ul>
<li><pre>static public void setGlobalCredentialsProvider(String url, CredentialsProvider provider) throws HTTPException</pre>
This is no longer supported because
only the host+port part of the URL would be used and
that was provided at session creation.
<li><pre>static public void setGlobalCredentials(String url, Credentials creds) throws HTTPException</pre>
Same reason as immediate prior case.
<li><pre>public void setCredentials(String url, Credentials creds) throws HTTPException</pre>
Same reason as immediate prior case.
<li><pre>public void setCredentialsProvider(String url, CredentialsProvider provider) throws HTTPException</pre>
Same reason as immediate prior case.
</ul>

<h4>Authentication-Related HTTPSession Methods</h4>
The key objects for authentication are the classes
<em>org.apache.http.client.CredentialsProvider</em>
and
<em>org.apache.http.client.Credentials</em>.
Basically, when an instance of <em>CrendentialsProvider</em>'s
<em>getCredentials</em> method is invoked, it is expected to return
and instance of <em>Credentials</em>.
The two are distinguished because <em>Credentials</em> is immutable,
while <em>CredentialsProvider</em> can return a different set of
<em>Credentials</em> every time it is invoked.
<p>
To see this, consider the case where we want to access a number of
datasets on a server, where each dataset might be protected by some
combination of username+password. This is often called BASIC authentication.
When a request is made for one of these datasets, the <em>CredentialsProvider</em>
is invoked and it may do something like pop up a window to ask the user
for the needed username+password for this dataset. When another dataset
is accessed, it may pop up another window. Thus the same
<em>CredentialsProvider</em> may be used repeatedly. In each case, it
would return a specific instance of <em>Credentials</em> that contains
the requisite username+password for that specific dataset.
<p>
<em>HTTPSession</em> supports credentials caching so that if the client
repeatedly accesses the same dataset, it will be asked for the
username+password only once. 
<p>
As a rule, it is best to use the methods here that take <em>CredentialsProvider</em>
argument. The case of a <em>Credentials</em> argument is only for convenience
when only a specific set of credentials is known a-priori.
<ul>
<li><pre>static public void setGlobalCredentialsProvider(CredentialsProvider provider) throws HTTPException</pre>
<li><pre>static public void setGlobalCredentials(Credentials creds) throws HTTPException</pre>
<li><pre>public void setCredentialsProvider(CredentialsProvider provider) throws HTTPException</pre>
<li><pre>public void setCredentials(Credentials creds) throws HTTPException</pre>
</ul>

<h4>SSL HTTPSession Methods</h4>
SSL support has changed significantly since Apache httpclient 4.5.
The following method is exported (public), although using the
jvm -D flags (see below) is the preferred method.
<ul>
<li><pre>static public void setGlobalSSLAuth(String keypath, String keypassword, String trustpath, String trustpassword)</pre>
</ul>
This method can be used when a client needs to use what is called
"client-side" authentication or "mutual" authentication.
It is used in conjunction with the "https" scheme. It means that not
only does the server provide an authentication certificate to the client,
the client must also provide an authentication certificate to the server
(thus the term "mutual").
<p>
For this case, the client must provide access to a password
protected "keystore" in which the client certificate is stored.
The first two parameters of the above method specify these.
<p>
In addition, the client may wish to use a so-called trust store
in which the set of certificates for trusted servers is stored.
the last two arguments specify these.
<p>
The above method is not strictly necessary since the relevant
values can be specified on the java VM command line using the following
JVM parameters.
<ul>
<li>"-Dkeystore=..."
<li>"-Dkeystorepassword=..."
<li>"-Dtruststore=..."
<li>"-Dtruststorepassword=..."
</ul>

<h4>Proxy Support</h4>
Proxy support is provided by the following method
or (preferably) by the jvm -D flags below.
<ul>
<li><pre>static public void setGlobalProxy(String proxyurl)</pre>
</ul>
The url string argument specifies how to access the proxy server.
<p>
Notes:
<ul>
<li> The path, query, and fragment parts of the URL are ignored.
<li> If the proxy needs authentication, then the URL needs to include
it in the form of "http(s)://username:password@host:port".
</ul>
The equivalent of the above method can be specified on the java VM
command line using the following JVM parameters.
<ul>
<li>"-Dproxyurl=..."
</ul>
This flag is a URL that specifies the proxy.
<p>

<h4>Miscellaneous -D Flags</h4>
It is possible to control the value of certain other session
parameters using the following -D flags as arguments to the
JVM. These can be set for a client and/or a server.

<table>
<tr><th>-D Flag<th>Description
<tr><td>tds.http.conntimeout<td>Connection timeout in seconds
<tr><td>tds.http.sotimeout<td>Socket timeout in seconds
</table>

<h3><a name="HTTPMethod">HTTPMethod</a></h3>
This class encapsulates the information
about a given method request and response.
Its primary operation is <em>execute()</em>,
which causes a request to be sent to a server
and a response obtained.
<p>
An instance of <em>HTTPMethod</em> always operates
in the context of a parent <em>HTTPSession</em> object.
It is possible to create an <em>HTTPMethod</em> object
without specifying a parent session object. In that case,
a temporary <em>HTTPSession</em> object is created by
the method object. The lifetime of the session object is
the same as the method object: that is, when the method object
is closed, the temporary session object will also be closed.
<p>
<em>HTTPMethod</em> takes a URL string as its primary argument.
Optionally (but normally) , it may take an <em>HTTPSession</em>
object as an additional argument.
<p>
An important point about the URL argument is that it must be
<b>compatible</b> with the <em>AuthScope</em> of the parent <em>HTTPSession</em>
object. The term "compatible" means the following.
The method url is <it>compatible</i> if all of the following are true.
<ol>
<li>the URL's host+port is the same as the session scope's host+port.
<li>the URL's scheme is compatible with the session scope's scheme,
where compatible means either that the two schemes are identical or one
is the same as the other with a trailing 's' character removed &mdash;
so "http" is compatible with "https".
</ol>

<h3><a name="HTTPMethodStream">HTTPMethodStream</a></h3>
This class is a subclass of <em>java.io.InputStream</em>.  Its purpose
is to allow other classes to access the data stream associated with a
method response.  It is often convenient to get data using an
<em>HTTPMethod</em> instance in a Java scope, but then pass the
associated input stream out of scope. When the stream is closed (or hits
EOF) somewhere else in the code, it is desirable that the associated
method and its resources be closed automatically.

<h3><a name="HTTPException">HTTPException</a></h3>
This class is a subclass of <em>java.io.IOException</em>.
It is the exception for reporting errors out of the
<em>ucar.httpservices</em> package.

<h3><a name="HTTPFactory">HTTPFactory</a></h3>
The <em>HTTPFactory</em> class provides the API for obtaining
instances of an HTTPSession or HTTPMethod object.
<p>
For session creation, the following methods are provided:
<ul>
<li><pre>static public HTTPSession newSession(String host, int port) throws HTTPException</pre>
<li><pre>static public HTTPSession newSession(String url) throws HTTPException</pre>
<li><pre>static public HTTPSession newSession(AuthScope target) throws HTTPException</pre>
</ul>
The idea is that the argument(s) are sufficient to extract a usable
host+port+scheme. The
<a href="#AuthScope">AuthScope</a>
argument uses a class specific to the Apache httpclient (core) library.
<p>
For method creattion, the supported methods are: GET, HEAD, PUT, POST,
and OPTIONS.  For each method Xxx, the following factory methods are provided.
<ul>
<li><pre>static public HTTPMethod Xxx(HTTPSession session, String url) throws HTTPException</pre>
<li><pre>static public HTTPMethod Xxx(String url) throws HTTPException</pre>
</ul>
As described above, if the session is not explicit, then a temporary session
object will be created with the <em>AuthScope</em> taken from the url.
Also, if the session is explicit, then the url argument must be compatible
with the session's <em>AuthScope</em>.

<h3><a name="HttpClientManager">ucar.nc2.util.net.HttpClientManager</a></h3>
This class is a utility class to perform some specialized
actions. Its name begins with "Http" rather than
"HTTP" for historical reasons. It has been extensively modified
internally to utilize the <em>ucar.httpservices</em> package.
<p>
This class contains only static methods and these methods
perform the following utility operations.
<ul>
<li>Return the contents of a URL as a String
<pre>
String getUrlContentsAsString(String urlencoded, int maxKbytes)
</pre>
Make a request on the specified url and return its response
as a String of max length <em>maxKbytes</em>.
<p>
<li>Get the contents of URL and store in a file.
<pre>
void copyUrlContentsToFile(String urlencoded, File file) throws HTTPException
</pre>
Make a request on the specified url, obtain its contents
and write to the specified file.
<p>
<li>Append the contents of a URL to the end of a File
<pre>
long appendUrlContentsToFile(String url, File file, long start, long end)
</pre>
Make a request on the specified url, obtain its contents
and append to the specified file.
<p>
<li>Initialize the Client Manager class
<pre>
void init(CredentialsProvider provider, String userAgent)
</pre>
Initialize to use a specified credentials provider and user agent
when making requests.
</ul>

<h3><u>Examples</u></h3>

<h4>Example 1: Create/Use/Release Cycle</h4>
This example uses try-with-resources instead
of explicit calls to the close methods.
<pre>
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] argv)
    {
	String url = argv[0];
	try (HTTPSession session = new HTTPSession(url);
	     HTTPMethod method = HTTPMethod.Get(session,url);
	     int status = method.execute();
             System.out.printf("Execute: status code = %d\n", status);
	} // implicitly calls method.close() then session.close()
    }
}
</pre>

<h4>Example 2: Using HttpClientManager</h4>
<pre>
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] argv)
    {
	String url = argv[0[];
	string content = HttpClientManager.getUrlContentsAsString(url,1024);
    }
}
</pre>

<h4>Example 3: Setting Some Global Parameters</h4>
This example set some global parameters and also shows
the use of an implicit session.
<pre>
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] argv)
    {
	String url = argv[0];
	String userpwd = argv[1];

	// Set some parameters at the global level
        HTTPSession.setGlobalCredentials(new UsernamePasswordCredentials(userpwd));
	HTTPSession.setGlobalUserAgent("netcdf/java");
	HTTPSession.setMaxConnections(4);
	HTTPSession.setGlobalAuthenticationPreemptive(true);

        try (HTTPMethod method = HTTPMethod.Get(url)) {//implicit session
	    int status = method.execute();
            System.out.printf("Execute: status code = %d\n", status);
	}
    }
}
</pre>

<h4>Example 4: Setting Some Local Parameters</h4>
<pre>
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] argv)
    {
	String url = argv[0];
	String userpwd = argv[1];

        try (HTTPSession session = new HTTPSession(url)) {
            session.setCredentials(new UsernamePasswordCredentials(userpwd));
	    session.setUserAgent("agent");
	    session.setConnectionManagerTimeout(475);
	    session.setSoTimeout(475);
	    try (HTTPMethod method = HTTPMethod.Get(session)) {
		int status = method.execute();
		System.out.printf("Execute: status code = %d\n", status);
	    } // method.close()
	} // session.close()
    }
}
</pre>

<h3><a name="AuthScope">Appendix A: AuthScope</a></h3>
The
<a href="https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/http/auth/AuthScope.html">AuthScope</a>
class is used in a number of places in the <em>ucar.httpservices</em>
package. It has a number of constructors, the primary ones
are as follows.
<ul>
<li><pre>AuthScope(String hostname, int port)</pre>
<li><pre>AuthScope(String hostname, int port, String realm, String scheme)</pre>
</ul>
If the scheme is not explicit then the default scheme (usually "http").
The realm argument should always be AuthScope.ANY_REALM.
