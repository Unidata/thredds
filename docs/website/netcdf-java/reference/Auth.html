<h2><a name="HTTPAuthStore"><u>HTTPAuthStore</u></a></h2>
New classes are introduced to the package ucar.httpclient
to support a variety of authorization mechanisms.
These mechanisms currently are Http BASIC and DIGEST,
and client side keys for SSL connections.
Note that for outgoing firewalls that require authentication,
the BASIC or DIGEST schemes will be used as a rule.
<p>
  Most of these classes are invisible to the user. The user
  indirectly accesses them through the HTTPSession interface.

<p>
  The primary new classes are
<ul>
  <li><em>HTTPAuthStore</em>
  <li><em>HTTPAuthScheme</em>
  <li><em>HTTPAuthProvider</em>
  <li><em>HTTPSSLProvider</em>
</ul>
<p>
  The goal of these new classes
  is to provide a general approach to the problem of
  client-side authorization with respect to some server.
  The approach is to provide various kinds of authorization
  credentials (broadly construed) to servers by clients.

<p>
  Before reading this document, the reader should have read the
  <a href="./Session.html">Session.html</a>
  and the
  <a href="HTTPauthentication.html">HTTPauthentication.html</a>
  documents to
  understand the context in which the authorization mechanisms
  operate. The section <a href="#Status">Status</a> should
  also be read to get important information about the current
  state of this code.

<p>
  The authorization schemes currently
  supported are as follows.
<ol>
  <li> HTTP Basic
  <li> HTTP Digest
  <li>Client-side keys using java
    keystores and truststores.
</ol>
<p>

<h3>Global and Per-Connection Credentials</h3>
There is an additional factor. It is
desirable to support both "global" and "per-session"
authorization.
<ul>
  <li>Global &mdash; this means that a
    single set of credentials is set globally and is adequate
    for all code running within a single program (i.e. linux or
    windows process).
    <p>
  <li>Per-session &mdash; this means
    that each session (HTTPSession instance) may have a separate
    set of credentials. Further, it must be guaranteed that no
    connection is re-used to avoid inadvertent access to some
    other set of credentials.
</ul>

<h3>Delegation</h3>
Finally, there is the "delegation" problem. This is when a
client program (or a server program acting as a client)
wants to masquerade as some user and utilize the
authorizations provided for that user. Of course, this
requires that the program be sufficiently trusted so that is
will handle the delegation responsibly.
<p>
  Delegation is likely to be most common on the server-side because a
  server will be handling multiple clients and may have to access
  additional information on behalf of various clients.

<h2>Approach</h2>
Access rights are stored in a "database" that is
globally accessible to all code within a single operating
system process and is independent of any threading.
The fact that this database is shared is important so that
a consistent set of credentials is provided everywhere within
the operating system process.
<p>
  This database is kept as class level object consisting of a set
  of row instances of type <em>HTTPAuthStore.Entry</em>.
  The <u>columns</u> of each entry are as follows.
<ol>
  <li>
    <u>scheme</u> of type <em>HTTPAuthScheme</em>
    (with a special instance acting as the wildcard ANY_SCHEME).
    <p>
      <li>
        <u>url</u> of type <em>String</em>
        (with a special instance acting as the wildcard ANY_URL).
        <p>
  <li>
    <u>creds</u> of type
    <em>org.apache.commons.httpclient.auth.CredentialsProvider</em>.
</ol>
<p>
  The <em>HTTPAuthStore</em>
  <a href="#HTTPAuthStore.API">API</a>
  itself provides operations to insert and delete rows, and to search
  for rows matching specified criteria.

<h2>Class Descriptions</h2>

<h3><a name="HTTPSSLProvider">HTTPSSLProvider</a></h3>
Note that any typical implementation of the
<em>CredentialsProvider</em>
interface may be used for an <em>HTTPAuthStore</em>
database row.
As a special case and when the scheme is SSL,
then the user should use the
provided
<em>HTTPSSLProvider</em> <a href="#HTTPSSLProvider.API">class</a>
for this field. Its constructor requires arguments for
the client side keystore plus password and the client side
truststore plus password.
The keystore and truststore arguments are absolute paths.
<p>
  If the truststore is not specified then essentially any certificate provided
  by the server will be accepted (including, specifically,
  self-signed certificates).

<h3><a name="HTTPAuthScheme">HTTPAuthScheme</a></h3>
The <u>scheme</u> field is assumed to store an instance of
the enum type <a href="#HTTPAuthScheme.API">HTTPAuthScheme</a>.
The elements of the enum are as follows:
<ul>
  <li> BASIC
  <li> DIGEST
  <li> SSL
  <li> ANY
</ul>
<p>
  BASIC and DIGEST operate essentially the same and require as
  credentials a principal and a password. The SSL scheme
  is to accomodate client-side key authentication. It requires
  information about a keystore and truststore and their
  associated passwords. The ANY value serves as a wildcard.

<h3><a name="HTTPAuthProvider">HTTPAuthProvider</a></h3>
The <em>HTTPAuthProvider</em> class implements the
<em>org.apache.commons.httpclient.auth.CredentialsProvider</em>
interface. It is used as a wrapper for the <em>HTTPAuthStore.Entry</em>
<u>creds</u> field and manages accessing the auth store
at the appropriate point to obtain the information
needed for getting the proper credentials.
<p>
  The constructor for
  <em>HTTPAuthProvider</em>
  takes a URL as an argument.
  When the <em>getCredentials</em> method is invoked
  the URL plus the <em>AuthScheme</em> argument
  are used to locate the most specific matching entry
  in the auth store database. This entry is then used
  to properly invoke the correct <em>CredentialsProvider</em>
  instance.

<h2><a name="url.match">URL Matching</a></h2>
When searching the auth store rows for matches, schemes
are either simple equal or not equal. However, when matching the url
field, urls may match in a more complicated way.
In particular, a missing user info field
or missing path will act as a wildcard when matching to
another url. For the path, prefix matching also can result
in a match.

<h2><a name="Serialization">Serialization</a></h2>
Encrypted serialization of the auth store is supported
with significant limitations.
The relevant methods are as follows.
<ul>
  <li>static public void serialize(OutputStream ostream, String password)
    throws HTTPException
  <li>static public void deserialize(InputStream istream, String password)
    throws HTTPException
</ul>
<p>
  Serialization (and de-serialization) of the
  <u>scheme</u> and <u>url</u>
  fields are straightforward.

<p>
  <u><strong>WARNING</strong></u>: Serialization of the <u>creds</u> field
  is tricky because the instance may or may itself
  be serializable. If it supports the <em>Serializable</em>
  interface, then it will be serialized.
  If it does not implement that interface, then
  the class of the <em>creds</em> field is serialized
  instead. This will be ok for essentially stateless
  implementations of <em>CredentialsProvider</em>, but
  otherwise will produce incorrect results.

<h2><a name="Appendices"><u>Appendices: Authorization APIs</u></a></h2>

<h3><a name="HTTPAuthStore.API">HTTPAuthStore API</a></h3>
The primary API methods are described.
All of the following methods are tagged "static public".
Other, minor methods, exist and the Javadoc should be consulted
for those.

<h4><u>Insert</u></h4>
The single method takes an <em>HTTPAuthStore.Entry</em>
instance to insert into the auth store database.
It returns false if the entry instance
replaces an existing row, else returns true.
<pre>
boolean insert(HTTPAuthStore.Entry entry);
</pre>

<h4><u>Remove</u></h4>
The single method takes an <em>HTTPAuthStore.Entry</em>
instance to remove from the auth store database.
It returns false if the entry instance
is not in the current database, else returns true.
<pre>
boolean remove(HTTPAuthStore.Entry entry);
</pre>

<h4><u>Search</u></h4>
The single method takes an <em>HTTPAuthStore.Entry</em>
instance to serve as the pattern to search the auth store database.
It returns an array of matching entries, which may be zero length.
The returned list is ordered from most restrictive to least restrictive.
<pre>
Entry[] search(HTTPAuthStore.Entry entry);
</pre>

<p>
  The search pattern match is defined by the following tests.

<p>
<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <td>Scheme
    <td width=750>
      Comparison is by ==; wildcard is specified by ANY_SCHEME.
  <tr>
    <td>URL
    <td>
      Comparison is as defined <a href="#url.match">above</a>.
</table>

<h3><a name="HTTPAuthScheme.API">HTTPAuthScheme API</a></h3>
The primary methods of <em>HTTPAuthScheme</em> enum
are as follows.
<ul>
  <li>public String getSchemeName() returns a canonical string representing
    the name of the scheme.
  <li>static public HTTPAuthScheme schemeForName(String name)
    returns an HTTPAuthScheme value given a string and returns null if there
    is no such value.
  <li>static public HTTPAuthScheme fromAuthScope(String name)
    returns an HTTPAuthScheme value given a string from an <em>AuthScope</em>
    instance and returns null if the name is not recognized.
</ul>

<h3><a name="HTTPAuthProvider.API">HTTPAuthProvider API</a></h3>
The primary methods of the <em>HTTPAuthProvider</em> class
are as follows.
<ul>
  <li>public HTTPAuthProvider(String url) is the constructor
    taking a url for controlling the search into the auth store.
  <li>public Credentials getCredentials(AuthScheme authscheme,
    String host, int port, boolean isproxy)
    throws CredentialsNotAvailableException is invoked
    by the underlying authorization code to get the credentials
    and this method in turn consults the auth store.
</ul>

<h3><a name="HTTPSSLProvider.API">HTTPSSLProvider API</a></h3>
The primary methods of the <em>HTTPAuthProvider</em> class
are as follows.
<ul>
  <li>public HTTPSSLProvider(String keystore,String keypass,
    String truststore,String trustpass)
  <li>public HTTPSSLProvider(String keystore, String keypass)
  <li>public String getKeystore()
  <li>public String getKeypassword()
  <li>public String getTruststore()
  <li>public String getTrustpassword()
  <li>public Credentials getCredentials(AuthScheme authscheme,
    String host,
    int port,
    boolean isproxy)
    throws CredentialsNotAvailableException<br>
    (Note that this interface is abused and is not intended
    for external invocation).
</ul>

<h2><a name="Status">Status</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li> Currently, this code is in the Thredds code trunk.
    Backward compatibility is provided for
    the old handling of ESG keystore arguments
    using the java -D flags
    <em>keystore</em>,
    <em>keystorepassword</em>,
    <em>truststore</em>, and
    <em>truststorepassword</em>.
</ul>
