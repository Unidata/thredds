<h1>Mapping between the CDM and NetCDF-4 Data Models </h1>

<p><em>last modified: June 2014</em></p>
<p>The CDM data model is close to, but not identical to the <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/workshops/2008/netcdf4/Nc4DataModel.html">NetCDF-4
  data model</a>. When reading netCDF-4 files, one is interested in the mapping from netCDF-4 to CDM. This mapping is relatively stable. As of version 4.3, the
  CDM can write to netCDF-4 files, and one is interested in the mapping from CDM to netCDF-4. This mapping is still being developed, eg to give users some
  control where needed.</p>
<p>NetCDF-4 intentionally supports a simpler data model than HDF5, which means there are HDF5 files that cannot be converted to netCDF-4. See: <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/faq.html#fv15">https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/faq.html#fv15</a></p>

<h2>Data Model Differences</h2>
<h3>DataTypes</h3>

<blockquote>
  <h4>From netCDF-4 to CDM</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A netCDF-4 <em>Compound</em> is a CDM <em>Structure</em>. Both can be arbitrarily nested. The components of the Compound type are called <em>fields</em> in NetCDF-4 and <em>member variables</em> in the CDM.</li>
    <li>A netCDF-4 <em>Enum</em> is a CDM <em>enum1, enum2, </em>or<em> enum4</em> and references a <em>EnumTypedef</em> which holds the (enum, String) map.</li>
    <li>A netCDF-4 <em>Vlen</em> is mapped to a CDM <em>variable length Dimension</em>.</li>
    <li>A netCDF-4 <em>Opaque </em>type is a CDM <em>opaque </em>type, but the length of the data cannot be found until you read the data.</li>
    <li>NetCDF-4 signed and unsigned <em>byte, short, int, long</em> are mapped to CDM <em>byte, short, int, long</em>. If unsigned, the attribute <strong><em>_Unsigned
      = &quot;true&quot;</em> </strong>is added to the CDM Variable, and <strong>Variable.isUnsigned()</strong> is true, as well as <strong>Array.isUnsigned(),</strong> from any data that is read from the variable.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4><strong>From CDM to netCDF-4</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A CDM array of Opaque may have a different length for each Opaque object. May have to read to find maximum length.</li>
    <li>A CDM Structure may have member Variables that use shared dimensions. NetCDF4 / HDF5 does not support shared dimensions in Compound fields. If writing CDM to netCDF4, currently we just anonymize the shared dimensions.</li>
    <li>A CDM Structure member Variables may have attributes. NetCDF4 / HDF5 does not support attributes on fields in Compound fields. The CDM uses <a href="Netcdf4CompoundAttributes.html">these conventions</a> for specifying attributes on compound fields.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Type Definitions</h3>

<blockquote>
  <h4>From netCDF-4 to CDM</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A netCDF-4 <em>Enumeration Type </em>becomes a CDM<em> EnumTypedef</em>.</li>
    <li>All other netCDF-4 type definitions are repeated for each CDM variable that uses them. The attribute <strong>_Typedef = &quot;<em>typename</em>&quot;
      </strong><strong> </strong>is added to the CDM Variable, where typename is the name of the netCDF-4 type.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>From CDM to netCDF-4</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A CDM<em> EnumTypedef</em> becomes a netCDF-4 <em>Enumeration Type.</em></li>
    <li>If a CDM Variable has an attribute <strong>_Typedef = &quot;<em>typename</em>&quot;, </strong>then the Variables' definition is made into a netCDF-4 type.
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Attributes</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>In CDM, an attribute type may only be a scalar or 1D array of signed <em>byte, short, int, long, float, double, </em>or<em> String</em>. A <em>char</em> type
    is mapped to a <em>String</em>.</p>
  <h4>From netCDF-4 to CDM</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>An attribute of <em>compound</em> type in netCDF-4 is <em>flattened</em>, by making each field a separate attribute, with name <em>attName.fieldName</em>
      in the CDM.
    </li>
    <li>If the compound attribute is for a compound variable, and the field name of the attribute matches a field name of the variable, the attribute is added to
      that field instead of being flattened.
    </li>
    <li>An attribute of <em>enum</em> type in netCDF-4 becomes a <em>String</em> type in the CDM. <strong>???</strong></li>
    <li>An attribute of <em>opaque</em> type in netCDF-4 becomes a <em>byte</em> type in the CDM.</li>
    <li>An attribute of <em>vlen of type</em> in netCDF-4 becomes an array of <em>type</em> in the CDM.</li>
    <li>An attribute of an unsigned <em>byte, short, int</em> in netCDF-4 is promoted to a signed <em>short, int, or long</em> in the CDM.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4><strong>From CDM to netCDF-4</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Attributes on member variables of Structures are made into a compound attribute on the parent Structure.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Differences between netCDF-4 C and Java libraries for netCDF4 files</h2>
<h3>Unsigned types</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The C library uses unsigned integer types: NC_UBYTE, NC_USHORT, NC_UINT, NC_UINT64.</li>
  <li>The Java library does not have separate types for unsigned integers, but adds the reserved attribute <em><strong>_Unsigned = &quot;true&quot;</strong></em> when the variable is unsigned. One can check this with <em>Variable.isUnsigned(), Attribute.isUnsigned(), </em>and <em>Array.isUnsigned()</em>. Conversions done by the library are aware of this convention. Java does not have unsigned types, and we dont want to double the internal memory requirements by widening the data. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Enum Typedefs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If there is a enum typedef that is not used by a variable, it will not show up in the enum typedefs. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When a variable is chunked, an integer array attribute named <em>_ChunkSize</em> is added to the variable, whose values are the chunk size for each
    dimension.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Creation Order</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The C library preserves the creation order of the Dimensions, Variables, Groups and Attributes, while the Java library does not.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compound field Types</h3>
<ul>
  <li>in a netCDF4 file, fields in a Compound type may not have shared dimension.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2> Differences between netCDF-4 C and Java libraries for HDF5 files</h2>
<h3>Fixed length Strings with anonymous dimension</h3>
<ul>
  <li>HDF5 object: type = 3 (String) with a dimension.</li>
  <li>C library: turns these into variable length Strings</li>
  <li>Java library: turns these into char arrays, with an anonymous dimension</li>
</ul>
<h3>Anonymous dimensions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Java library:  retains anonymous dimensions</li>
  <li>C library: turn into shared dimensions, by matching on the dimension length</li>
</ul>
<h3>Time datatype (HDF type 2)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Java library: turn into a short, int ot long, depending on the precision</li>
  <li>C library: ignores this type</li>
</ul>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Internal Notes</h2>

<p>1) char arrays are interpreted as UTF-8 bytes array (Strings) when they are attributes . but data arrays are not, they are run through unsignedToShort() and
  cast to char. this seems like trouble.</p>

<p>2) nc4 allows arbitrary composition of vlen. cdm tries to map these to a variable length dimension, to get a ragged array, not part of the data type. But
  Arrays are rectangular, so its a difficult fit. </p>

<p>could define ArrayRagged which maps to C multidim arrays.</p>

<p>its natural to map</p>
<pre> int data(x,y,*) -&gt; int(*) data(x,y)</pre>
<p>but it doesn't generalize well to nested vlens. nc4 solution is to declare each type separately and chain them:</p>
<pre> int(*) type1;
 type1(*) type2;
 type2 data(x,y);

</pre>
<p>Array.isVariableLength(). IOSP might return ArrayInteger from int data(*). Needs to return ArrayObject for int data(3,*), with Array.isVariableLength()
  true.</p>
<pre>
int(*)     returns ArrayInt
int(3,*)   returns ArrayObject(3) with ArrayInt(*) inside
int(*,3)  returns Array(n,3), whatever n happens to be.
int(3,*,*) returns ArrayObject(3) with ArrayObject(*) inside with ArrayInt(*) inside.
int(*,3,*) returns ArrayObject(n) with ArrayObject(3) inside with ArrayInt(*) inside.
int(*,*,3) returns ArrayObject(n) with ArrayInt(*,3) inside. OR  ArrayObject(n) with ArrayObject(*) with ArrayInt(3) inside.

struct {
  int i1;
  float vf(*);
} s(3);

is like float(3,*) -> ArrayObject(3) with ArrayFloat(*), inside the ArrayStructure.
this is getting out of control
</pre>
<p>3) attributes : n4 can be user defined types, cdm: 1 dim array of primitive or String.</p>
<pre>
netcdf tst_enums {
  types:
    ubyte enum Bradys {Mike = 8, Carol = 7, Greg = 6, Marsha = 5, Peter = 4, Jan = 3, Bobby = 2, Whats-her-face = 1, Alice = 0} ;

// global attributes:
  Bradys :brady_attribute = Alice, Peter, Mike ;
}

netcdf R:/testdata/netcdf4/nc4/tst_enums.nc {
 types:
  enum Bradys { 'Alice' = 0, 'Whats-her-face' = 1, 'Bobby' = 2, 'Jan' = 3, 'Peter' = 4, 'Marsha' = 5, 'Greg' = 6, 'Carol' = 7, 'Mike' = 8};

 :brady_attribute = "Alice", "Peter", "Mike";
}
