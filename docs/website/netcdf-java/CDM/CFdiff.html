<h1>Differences between CDM and CF</h1>

<p>CF is a metadata standard for netCDF files. CDM is a data model for many differerent data formats, which generally conforms to CF whenever the two overlap.
  This documents the differences in metadata interpretation.</p>

<h2>Coordinate Systems</h2>

<h3>Units of <em><strong>false_easting </strong></em>and<em><strong> false_northing</strong></em></h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/build/cf-conventions.html#appendix-grid-mappings">CF</a>:
    <em><strong>false_easting, </strong></em>and<em><strong> false_northing</strong></em> attribute values must be in the same units as the x and y projection
    coordinates.
  </li>
  <li>CDM: the attribute &quot;units&quot; may be specified on the dummy Coordinate Transform Variable, which overrides the
    <a href="../reference/StandardCoordinateTransforms.html#false_easting"></a>x/y coordinate units. This is needed when the projection does not have access to
    the x/y coordinates.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Required use of Lat/Lon Coordinates</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/build/cf-conventions.html#grid-mappings-and-projections">CF:</a> requires that all files include latitude and longitude coordinates.
  </li>
  <li>CDM: When the data are on a projection, this requirement implies that 2 dimension lat(y,x) and lon(y,x) must be included in the file. When the 1D x(x) and
    y(y) coordinates are also included, along with a <a href="../reference/StandardCoordinateTransforms.html">standard grid_mapping</a> that specifies the
    projection, the CDM uses the projection for the Coordinate System layer, and not the lat, lon variables. In some circumstances, for example in extracting a
    single variable into a seperate file, including the 2D lat(y,x) and lon(y,x) variables can triple the size of the file. CDM therefore allows a user to
    create an &quot;almost-CF compliant&quot; file without the 2D lat(y,x) and lon(y,x) variables. Generally the user also has an option to include these
    variables when strict compliance is needed.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Calendar Date Coordinates</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/build/cf-conventions.html#time-coordinate">CF</a>: <em>Variables representing time must always
    explicitly include the units attribute. The units attribute takes a string value formatted as per the recommendations in the Udunits package
    [<a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/build/cf-conventions.html#udunits" title="[UDUNITS]"><abbr>UDUNITS</abbr></a>] </em>This implies
    that a time coordinate always has a numeric data type, and uses udunits to transform <em>&quot;value time_unit since reference&quot;</em> into a date.
  </li>
  <li>CDM:
    See<a href="CalendarDateTime.html"> CDM Calendar Dates</a> for details.
    <ul>
      <li>Also accepts time coordinates as ISO formatted Strings. The variable data type may be String or Char.</li>
      <li>As of CDM 4.3, <a href="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/">joda time</a> is used to parse time units, instead of udunits. This allows the CDM to
        process the <a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/build/cf-conventions.html#calendar">CF 'calendar' attribute</a>.
      </li>
      <li>An extended date syntax is also supported : &quot;CALENDAR period SINCE reference_date&quot;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Default calendar: for udunits, and therefore for CF, the default calendar is <em>gregorian</em> (&quot;Mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar&quot;). For CDM,
    the default calendar is <em>proleptic_gregorian</em> (ISO8601 standard). This only matters for dates before 1582.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Discrete Sampling Geometries</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/build/cf-conventions.html#discrete-sampling-geometries">CF</a>: Convention for Discrete Sampling
    Geometries (aka &quot;point data&quot;) were added to CF version 1.6.
  </li>
  <li>CDM: the implementation has some differences, described <a href="../reference/FeatureDatasets/CFpointImplement.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
