<h1>Unidata's Common Data Model Version 4 </h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p> Unidata&rsquo;s Common Data Model (CDM) is an abstract <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model">data model</a> for scientific datasets. It merges
  the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">netCDF</a>, <a href="http://www.opendap.org/">OPeNDAP</a>, and
  <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf5/">HDF5</a> data models to create a common API for many types of scientific data. The NetCDF Java library is an
  implementation of the CDM which can read many <a href="../reference/formats/FileTypes.html">file formats</a> besides netCDF. We call these <em><strong>CDM
    files,</strong></em> a shorthand for <em>files that can be read by the NetCDF Java library and accessed through the CDM data model</em>. </p>

<p>The Common Data Model has three layers, which build on top of each other to add successively richer semantics:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <strong><em><a href="#dataAccess">data access layer</a></em></strong>, also know as the <strong><em>syntactic layer,</em></strong> handles data reading and writing.</li>
  <li>The <strong><em><a href="#CoordSys">coordinate system</a></em></strong> layer identifies the coordinates of the data arrays. Coordinates are a completely general concept for
    scientific data; we also identify specialized <strong><em>georeferencing coordinate systems</em></strong>, which are important to the Earth Science
    community.
  </li>
  <li>The <strong><em><a href="#ScientificFeatureTypes">scientific feature type</a></em></strong> layer identifies specific types of data, such as <em>grids</em>, <em>radial</em>, and <em>point
    data</em>, adding specialized methods for each kind of data.
  </li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A Dataset </strong>may be a netCDF, HDF5, GRIB, etc. file, an OPeNDAP dataset, a collection of files, or anything else which can be accessed through
  the netCDF API. We sometimes use the term <em><strong>CDM dataset</strong></em> to mean any of these possibilities, and to emphasize that a dataset does not
  have to be a file in netCDF format.</p>

<p>A <strong>Group</strong> is a container for Attributes, Dimensions, EnumTypedefs, Variables, and nested Groups<strong>. </strong>The Groups in a Dataset form
  a hierarchical tree, like directories on a disk.There is always at least one Group in a Dataset, the <strong>root Group</strong>, whose name is the empty
  string. </p>

<p>A <strong>Variable</strong> is a container for data. It has a <em>DataType</em>, a set of Dimensions that define its array shape, and optionally a set of
  Attributes. Any shared Dimension it uses must be in the same Group or a parent Group. </p>

<p>A <strong>Dimension</strong> is used to define the array shape of a Variable. It may be <em>shared</em> among Variables, which provides a simple yet powerful
  way of associating Variables. When a Dimension is shared, it has a unique name within the Group. If <em>unlimited</em>, a Dimension's length may increase. If
  <em>variableLength</em>, then the actual length is data dependent, and can only be found by reading the data. A variableLength Dimension cannot be shared or
  unlimited. </p>

<p>An <strong>Attribute</strong> has a name and a value, and associates arbitrary metadata with a Variable or a Group. The value is a scalar or one dimensional
  array of Strings or numeric values, so the possible data types are (<strong>String, byte, short, int, long, float, double</strong>). The integer types
  (<strong>byte, short, int, long</strong>) may be signed or unsigned.</p>

<p>A <strong>Structure</strong> is a type of Variable that contains other Variables, analogous to a <strong><em>struct</em></strong> in C, or a
  <em><strong>row</strong></em> in a relational database. In general, the data in a Structure are physically stored close together on disk, so that it is
  efficient to retrieve all of the data in a Structure at the same time. A Variable contained in a Structure is a <strong>member Variable</strong>, and can only
  be read in the context of its containing Structure. </p>

<p>A <strong>Sequence</strong> is a one dimensional Structure whose length is not known until you actually read the data. To access the data in a Sequence, you
  can only iterate through the Sequence, getting the data from one Structure instance at a time. </p>

<p>An <strong>EnumTypedef</strong> is an enumeration of Strings, used by Variables of type <em><strong>enum</strong></em>. </p>

<p>An <strong>Array</strong> contains the actual data for a Variable after it is read from the disk or network. You get an Array from a Variable by calling
  <strong><em>read()</em></strong> or its variants. An Array is rectangular in shape (like Fortran arrays). There is a specialized Array type for each of the
  DataTypes. </p>

<p>An <strong>ArrayStructure</strong> is a subclass of Array that holds the data for Structure Variables. Essentially it is an array of
  <strong>StructureData</strong> objects. </p>

<p><strong><a href="DataType.html">DataType</a></strong> describes the possible types of data: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The <strong>primitive numeric </strong> types are <strong><em>byte, short, int, long, float</em></strong> and <strong><em>double</em></strong>. The integer
    types (8-bit byte, 16-bit short, 32-bit int, 64-bit long) may be <em>signed</em> or <em>unsigned</em>. Variable and Array objects have
    <em>isUnsigned() </em>methods to indicate, and conversion to wider types is correctly done.</p>

  <p>A <strong>String</strong> is a variable length array of <a href="http://unicode.org/">Unicode</a> characters. A string is stored in a netCDF file as UTF-8
    encoded Unicode (note that ASCII is a subset of UTF-8). Libraries may use different internal representations, for example the Java library uses UTF-16
    encoding. </p>

  <p>A <strong>char</strong> is an 8-bit byte that contains uninterpreted character data. Typically a char contains a 7-bit ASCII character, but the character
    encoding is application-specific. Because of this, one should avoid using the char type for data. A legitimate use of <strong>char</strong> is with netCDF
    classic files, to store string data or attributes. The CDM will interpret these as UTF-8 encoded Unicode, but 7-bit ASCII encoding is probably the only
    portable encoding. </p>

  <p>An <strong>enum</strong> <strong>type</strong> is a list of distinct (integer, String) pairs. A Variable with enum type stores integer values, which can be
    converted to the String <em>enum value</em>. There are 3 enum types: <strong>enum1, enum2, </strong>and<strong> enum4</strong>, corresponding to storing the
    integer as a byte, short, or int.</p>

  <p>An <strong>opaque</strong> type stores uninterpreted blobs of bytes. The length of the blob is not known until it is read. An array of opaque objects may
    have different lengths for each of the blobs. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>An <strong>Object name</strong> refers to the name of a Group, Dimension, Variable, Attribute, or EnumTypedef. An object name is a String, a variable length
  array of Unicode characters. The <a href="Identifiers.html">set of allowed characters</a> is still being considered. </p>

<h3>Comparision to netCDF-4<a name="netcdf4"></a></h3>

<p>The CDM data model is close to, but not identical with the<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf/NetCDF_002d4-Format.html">
  netCDF-4 data model</a> (informal <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/workshops/2008/netcdf4/Nc4DataModel.html">UML</a>). However there is a
  complete 2-way mapping between the two models. In the CDM:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Non-shared dimensions are allowed, but netCDF-4 does not support these.</li>
  <li>An attribute type may only be a scalar or 1D array of byte, short, int, long, float, double, or String.</li>
  <li>Variables that are members of Structures may have attributes attached directly to them.</li>
  <li>The opaque type does not include the length of the opaque object, so an array of opaque may have different lengths for each object in the array.</li>
  <li>There are not separate unsigned integer types. The Variable and Array objects have <em>isUnsigned() </em>methods, and conversion to wider types is
    correctly done. Since Java does not have unsigned types, the alternative is to automatically widen unsigned data arrays, which would double the memory used.
  </li>
  <li>NetCDF-4 <em>user-defined types</em> are not kept independently from the variables that use them, except for <em>EnumTypedef</em>. The NetCDF-4
    user-defined types are mapped to these CDM constructs:
    <ul>
      <li>A NetCDF-4 <em>Compound</em> is a CDM <em>Structure</em>.</li>
      <li>A NetCDF-4 <em>Enum</em> is a CDM <em>enum1, enum2, </em>or<em> enum4</em> and references a <em>EnumTypedef</em> which holds the (enum, String) map.
      </li>
      <li>A NetCDF-4 <em>Vlen</em> is mapped to a CDM <em>variable length Dimension</em>.</li>
      <li>A NetCDF-4 <em>Opaque </em>type is a CDM <em>opaque </em>type, but the length of the data cannot be found until you read the variable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="Netcdf4.html">here</a> for detailed mapping between the NetCDF-4 and CDM data models.</p>

<h3><a name="dods"></a>Comparision to OPeNDAP (DAP 2)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>OPeNDAP allows nested attributes, but in the CDM, attributes may only be a scalar or 1D array of byte, short, int, long, float, double, or String.</li>
  <li>OPeNDAP does not have these data types: <em>signed byte</em>, <em>char</em>, <em>long</em>, <em>opaque</em>, <em>enum</em>.</li>
  <li>OPeNDAP does not have shared dimensions. These can be approximated by map vectors in Grid datatypes, but one cannot share dimensions across Grids, or
    between Arrays.
  </li>
  <li>OPeNDAP does not support Groups.</li>
  <li>OPeNDAP Sequences map to CDM Sequences, but CDM does not support relational constraints at this layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="Opendap.html">here</a> for more details on OPeNDAP processing.</p>

<h3>Comparision to HDF-5<a name="HDF5"></a></h3>

<p>As of version 4.1, the CDM can read all versions of HDF5 through version 1.8.4, except for the following HDF5 features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SZIP compression. The <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP/">SZIP library</a> is proprietary and does not have a Java implementation. Its
    not clear if we can even legally write one if we wanted to.
  </li>
  <li>Dataset region references. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=HDF5+region+reference">These</a> are used in NPOESS, but their purpose is unclear.
    Since they point to other datasets that are accessible through the CDM, all the data in the file can still be read by the CDM. However, whatever information
    the region reference represents is not currently accessible.
  </li>
  <li>Since HDF5 does not support shared dimensions, however, reading HDF5 files into the higher levels of the CDM (Coordinate Systems, Grids, etc) may not work
    like you want. For this reason we recommend using the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">netCDF-4 C library</a> for writing HDF5 files.
  Heres <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/developer/en/entry/dimensions_scales">why</a>.</li>
  <li>Hard links that cause cycles in the group structure are ignored. These break the CDM and netCDF-4 data model, in which groups comprise a tree. All info in the HDF-5 file is still available to CDM users, but certain paths that one could call from the HDF-5 library are not available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please send file examples if you find a problem with the CDM reading HDF5 files, other than the ones listed above.</p>

<h2><a name="CoordSys"></a>Coordinate System Object Model</h2>

<p><img src="../images/CoordSys.png" alt="CoordSys Object model" width="610" height="341"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A <em><strong>Variable</strong></em> can have zero or more Coordinate Systems containing one or more CoordinateAxis. A CoordinateAxis can only be part of a
  Variable's CoordinateSystem if the CoordinateAxis'
  set of Dimensions is a subset of the Variable's set of Dimensions. This ensures
  that every data point in the Variable has a corresponding coordinate value for
  each of the CoordinateAxis in the CoordinateSystem. </p>

<p>A <em><strong>Coordinate
  System</strong></em> has one or more CoordinateAxis, and zero
  or more CoordinateTransforms. </p>

<p>A <em><strong>CoordinateAxis</strong></em> is
  a subtype of Variable, and is optionally classified according to the types
  in <strong>AxisType</strong>. </p>

<p>A <em><strong>CoordinateTransform</strong></em> abstractly represents a transformation between
  CoordinateSystems, and currently is either a <strong>Projection</strong> or a <strong>Vertical Transform</strong>. </p>

<p>The <em><strong>AxisType</strong></em> enumerations are specific to the case
  of georeferencing coordinate systems. <em>Time</em> refers to the real date/time of the dataset. <em>Latitude</em> and <em>Longitude</em> identify standard
  horizontal coordinates. <em>Height</em> and <em>Pressure</em> identify the vertical coordinate.<em> GeoX</em> and <em>GeoY</em> are used in
  transfomations (eg projections) to <em>Latitude</em>, <em>Longitude</em>. <em>GeoZ</em> is used in vertical transformations to vertical <em>Height</em> or
  <em>Pressure</em>. <em>RadialAzimuth</em>, <em>RadialElevation</em> and <em>RadialDistance</em> designate polar coordinates and are used for Radial DataTypes.
  <em>RunTime</em> and <em>Ensemble</em> are used in forecast model output data. Often much more detailed information is required (geoid reference, projection
  parameters, etc), so these enumerations are quite minimal. </p>

<h3>Restrictions on CoordinateAxes</h3>

<p>These are the rules which restrict which Variables can be used as Coordinate Axes:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Shared Dimensions</strong>: All dimensions used by a Coordinate Axis must be shared with the data variable. When a variable is part of a
    Structure, the dimensions used by the parent Structure(s) are considered to be part of the nested Variable. Exceptions to this rule:
    <ol>
      <li> String valued Coordinate Axes may be represented by variables of type char with a non-shared dimension representing the string length.</li>
      <li>DSG joins.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Structures and nested Structures</strong>: When a variable is part of a Structure, the dimensions used by the parent Structure(s) are considered
    to be part of the nested Variable. Therefore, all dimensions used by the parent Structure(s) of a Coordinate Axis must be shared with the data variable.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Variable length dimensions and Sequences</strong>: A variable length dimension is always a private (non-shared) dimension, and therefore cannot be
    used by a Coordinate Axis, except when the data variable and coordinate variable are in the same Structure. For example, a Sequence is a variable length
    array of Structures, and the following examples are legitimate uses of coordinate axes.
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <pre>
Structure {
  float lat;
  float lon;
  float data;
    data:coordinates = &quot;lat lon&quot;;
} sample(*)</pre>
  <pre>
Structure {
  float lat;
  float lon; 
  
  Structure {
    float altitude;
    float data;
      data:coordinates = &quot;lat lon altitude&quot;;
  } profile(*)

} station(*)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Formally, a Variable is thought of as a sampled function whose domain is an
  index range; each CoordinateAxis is a scalar valued function on the same range;
  each CoordinateSystem is therefore a vector-valued function on the same range
  consisting of its CoordinateAxis functions. To take it one step further, when
  the CoordinateSystem function is invertible, the Variable can be thought of
  as a sampled function whose domain is the range of the Coordinate System, that
  is on <strong>Rn</strong> (the product space of real numbers). To be invertible,
  each CoordinateAxis should be invertible. For a 1-dimensional CoordinateAxis
  this simply means the coordinate values are strictly monotonic. For a 2 dimensional
  CoordinateAxis, it means that the lines connecting adjacent coordinates do not
  cross each other. For &gt; 2 dimensional CoordinateAxis, it means that the surfaces
  connecting the adjacent coordinates do not intersect each other. </p>

<h3>Current Encodings </h3>

<p>Neither NetCDF, HDF5, or OPeNDAP have Coordinate Systems as part of their APIs and data models, so their specification in a file is left to to higher level
  libraries (like HDF-EOS) and to <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html">conventions</a>. If you are writing netCDF files, we
  strongly recommend using <a href="http://cfconventions.org/">CF Conventions</a>.</p>

<p>NetCDF has long had the convention of specifying a 1-dimensional CoordinateAxis
  with a <em><strong>coordinate variable</strong></em>, which is a Variable with
  the same name as its single dimension. This is a natural and elegant way to
  specify a 1-dimensional CoordinateAxis, since there is an automatic association
  of the Coordinate Variable with any Varaible that uses its dimension. Unfortunately
  there are not similarly elegant ways to specify a multidimensional CoordinateAxis,
  and so various attribute conventions have sprung up, that typically list the
  CoordinateAxis variables, for example the CF Conventions has:</p>
<pre>  float lat(y,x);
  float lon(y,x);
  float temperature(y,x);
    temperature:coordinates=&quot;lat lon&quot;;
</pre>
<p>Note that in this example, there is no CoordinateSystem object, so the same
  list has to be added to each Variable, and any CoordinateTransform specifications
  also have to be added to each Variable. However, the common case is that all
  the Variables in a dataset use the same Coordinate System.</p>

<p>The <strong>ucar.nc2.dataset</strong> layer reads various Conventions and extracts the Coordinate Systems using the CoordSysBuilder framework. We often use a
  set of internal attributes called the <a href="../reference/CoordinateAttributes.html">underscore Coordinate</a> attributes as a way to standardize the
  Coordinate Systems infomation. Although these may work when working with Unidata software, we do not recommend them as a substitute for conventions such as
  CF.</p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>Scientific Feature Types<a name="ScientificFeatureTypes"></a></h2>

<p>Scientific Feature Types are a way to categorize scientific data. The CDM Feature Type layer turns CDM datasets into collections of Feature Type objects, and
  allows a user to extract subsets of the Feature Types "in coordinate space" i.e. using spatial and temporal bounding boxes. In contrast, the CDM Data Access
  layer provides array index space subsetting, and the client application must know how to map array indices into coordinate values.<br>
  <br>
  With these Feature Types objects, mapping into other data models like ISO/OGC becomes possible.</p>

<p>Feature Type definitions, APIU, and encodings are still being developed, so applications using these must be able to evolve along with the APIs.</p>
