There are many attribute conventions for encoding coordinate information into scientific datasets. While the CF
Conventions are recommended in netCDF files intended for public use, the CDM also uses *_Coordinate attributes* for
internal use, because they are in some cases simpler and more powerful. CoordSysBuilder plugins typically annotate
variables with these attributes and then let the CDM machinery build the CoordinateSystem objects.
This page documents their meaning and use.

== _Coordinate Attributes Definitions

=== _CoordinateAliasForDimension

A one-dimensional variable with monotonic values can act as a coordinate variable for its dimension, even when it doesn't have the same name as the dimension.
To indicate this, add an attribute to the variable called *\_CoordinateAliasForDimension*, whose value must be the name of its single dimension.
The variable is now called a *_\_Coordinate Alias_*. A Coordinate Alias is automatically added to any Variable using that dimension.

----
   double valtime(record);
     :long_name = "valid time";
     :units = "hours since 1992-1-1";
     :_CoordinateAliasForDimension = "record";
     :_CoordinateAxisType = "Time";
----

=== _CoordinateAxes

This attribute lists (in any order) names of Coordinate Axis Variables.
When a Variable is listed in a *_CoordinateAxes* attribute, it is made into a CoordinateAxis.

The attribute value must be a space-separated list of names of Coordinate Axis Variables in the same dataset:

----
 _CoordinateAxes = "time lev lat lon";
----

=== _CoordinateAxisType

This attribute is used on a Coordinate Axis variable to specify that it
is a space or time coordinate, such as lat, lon, altitude or time.
This is the preferred way to make a Variable into a CoordinateAxis (the other way is to list the variable in a *_CoordinateAxes* attribute).

The attribute value must be one of the valid link:#AxisTypes[Axis Types], for example:

-----------------------------
 _CoordinateAxisType = "Lat";
-----------------------------

=== _CoordinateAxisTypes

This attribute is used on a Coordinate Transform variable to specify that the Transform applies to any Coordinate System
with the specified list of Axis types.

The attribute value must be a list of the valid link:#AxisTypes[Axis Types], for example:

------------------------------------
 _CoordinateAxisTypes = "GeoZ Time";
------------------------------------

=== _CoordinateSystems

When many data Variables use the same Coordinate System it is convenient to factor out the information into one place.
We can create a dummy Variable which holds all of the information, called the _*Coordinate System Variable*_.
The *_CoordinateSystems* attribute is used on a data Variable to point to its Coordinate System Variable(s).
This is the only way to indicate multiple Coordinate Systems for the same data Variable.

The attribute value must be a space-separated list of names of Coordinate System Variables in the same dataset:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 _CoordinateSystems = "ProjectionCoordinateSystem LatLonCoordinateSystem";

  char ProjectionCoordinateSystem;
  ProjectionCoordinateSystem:_CoordinateAxes = "time depth_below_surface y x";
  ProjectionCoordinateSystem:_CoordinateTransforms = "Lambert_Conformal_Projection";
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== _CoordinateSystemFor

This is a way to assign explicit Coordinate System to a set of
variables, without having to name each variable. The value of the
attribute is a list of dimensions. A data variable that does not have an
explicit _CoordinateSystem or CoordinateAxes attribute will be assigned
this CoordinateSystem, if it contains exactly the listed dimensions.

[source,xml]
----
<variable name="coordSysVar4D" type="int" shape="">
  <attribute name="_CoordinateAxes" value="x y zpos time"/>
  <attribute name="_CoordinateTransforms" value="zpos"/>
  <attribute name="_CoordinateSystemFor" value="xpos ypos zpos time"/>
</variable>

<variable name="coordSysVar3D" type="int" shape="">
  <attribute name="_CoordinateAxes" value="x y time"/>
  <attribute name="_CoordinateSystemFor" value="xpos ypos time"/>
</variable>
----

=== _CoordinateTransforms

The *__CoordinateTransforms_* attribute is used only on Coordinate System
Variables, its value is a space-separated list of names of Coordinate Transform Variables in the same dataset.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 _CoordinateTransforms = "LambertProjection HybridSigmaVerticalTransform";

 char LambertProjection;
   LambertProjection:transform_name = "lambert_conformal_conic";
   LambertProjection:standard_parallel = 25.0;
   LambertProjection:longitude_of_central_meridian = 265.0;
   LambertProjection:latitude_of_projection_origin = 25.0;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a general mechanism for any transformation a file writer wants to define.
The Netcdf-Java library has a <<StandardCoordinateTransforms#,set of transforms that it recognizes>>, mostly based on the CF Conventions.

=== _CoordinateTransformType

This attribute is used to unambiguously indicate that a variable is a
Coordinate Transform Variable (the other way is to list the variable in
a *_CoordinateTransforms* attribute).

The attribute value must be *_Projection_* or *_Vertical_*.

-----------------------------------------
 _CoordinateTransformType = "Projection";
-----------------------------------------

=== _CoordinateZisPositive

Only used for vertical coordinate axes to disambiguate direction _*up*_ or _*down*_ of increasing coordinate values.

The attribute value must equal *_up_* or *_down_*

---------------------------------
 _CoordinateZisPositive = "down";
---------------------------------

== Summary of CDM Transforms

A *_Transform_* is a mathematical function that maps coordinates to a *_Reference Coordinate System_*.
A _Reference Coordinate System_ is one that uses _Latitude_, _Longitude_ for the horizontal axes, and
_Height_ or _Pressure_ for the vertical axis. A _projection transform_ maps coordinates to and from lat/lon,
while a _vertical transform_ maps coordinates to/from Height or Pressure.

A Transform is defined by creating a *_Coordinate Transform Variable_* (see
<<../tutorial/CoordinateAttributes#Example4,Example>>. The attributes of the
Coordinate Transform Variable become the parameters of the transform. A
variable is a Coordinate Transform Variable if one (or both) of these is true:

1.  It has a *_CoordinateTransformType* or *_CoordinateAxisTypes* attribute.
2.  It is listed in a *_CoordinateTransforms* attribute from any variable in the file.

Any Variable can be a Coordinate Transform Variable, as it is just a
container for attributes, i.e. the data values of the Variable are not necessarily
used by the transform. It is common to use a vertical coordinate to be a
Coordinate Transform Variable. Using a _dummy variable_ (with no useful
data in it) is also common. The examples here are done with dummy
variables.

== Summary of Rules for Processing Coordinate Attributes

=== Coordinate Axis Variable

May have attributes:

* *_CoordinateAxisType*
* *_CoordinateAliasForDimension*
* *_CoordinateZisPositive*

A Variable is made into a Coordinate Axis if one of these is true:

1.  It has any of the **_CoordinateAxisType**,
**_CoordinateAliasForDimension**, or *_CoordinateZisPositive* attributes.
2.  It is a coordinate variable
3.  It is listed in a *_CoordinateAxes* attribute from any variable in
the file.

A Variable is a *_coordinate variable_* if it is one dimensional and one of these is true:

1.  It has the same name as its dimension.
2.  It has the *_CoordinateAliasForDimension* attribute.

=== Coordinate System Variable

May have attributes:

* *_CoordinateAxes* (required, must be a complete list of axes, must have at least one axis).
* *_CoordinateSystemFor* (list of dimensions) will be assigned to any Variable which contains exactly these dimensions.
* *_CoordinateTransforms*

A variable is a Coordinate System Variable if one of these is true:

1.  It has a *_CoordinateTransforms* attribute.
2.  Its has a *_CoordinateSystemFor* attribute**.**
3.  It is listed in a *_CoordinateSystems* attribute from any variable in the file.

=== Coordinate Transform Variable

May have attributes:

* *_CoordinateTransformType*
* *_CoordinateSystems* apply to these Coordinate Systems
* *_CoordinateAxes* apply to any Coordinate Systems that contain all these axes
* *_CoordinateAxisTypes* apply to any Coordinate Systems that contain all these types of axes

A variable is a Coordinate Transform Variable if one of these is true:

1.  It has a *_CoordinateTransformType* or *_CoordinateAxisTypes* attribute.
2.  It is listed in a *_CoordinateTransforms* attribute from any variable in the file.

=== Data Variables

May have attributes:

* *_CoordinateSystems*
* *_CoordinateAxes*

You should use one or the other. If both are present, *_CoordinateSystems* is used.

[[CoordSysBuilder]]
=== Coordinate System Building

A Data Variable is assigned one or more Coordinate Systems in the following way:

.  If it has a *__CoordinateSystems_* attribute, the listed Coordinate Systems are assigned to the Variable,
and no further processing is done. This is an *_explicit_* Coordinate System.
.  Otherwise, all of its _Coordinate Variables_ plus any variables listed in a *__CoordinateAxes_* or *_coordinates_* attribute
will be made into an *_implicit_* Coordinate System.
If there are at least two axes, and the Coordinate System is _complete_, it will be asssigned to the data variable.
.  Otherwise, all _Coordinate Variables_ that are _compatible_ with the variable will be made into a _Coordinate System_.
If there are at least two axes, and the Coordinate System is _complete_, it will be asssigned to the data variable.
This is called the *_maximal_* Coordinate System.

where:

. A Coordinate Axis is *_compatible_* with a Variable if all of the Axis' Dimensions are used by the Variable, that is if
the domain of the Axis is a subset of the domain of the Variable.
. A Coordinate System is *_complete_* for a Variable if it uses all of the Variable's dimensions, that is, if the domains are equal

Notes:

.  The axes listed in the *__CoordinateAxes_* or *_coordinates_* attribute may or may not include Coordinate Variables.
These are always added to a Variable's Coordinate System..
.  Variables of type Structure cannot be a Coordinate Axis, although members can.
.  A Coordinate System is uniquely defined by its list of Coordinate Axes, so two Coordinate System can’t have the same list of axes.
.  _Coordinate attributes will take precedence over Conventions in our own decoding. Other software may implement differently.
.  When Coordinate Systems have been added, to prevent adding again, NcML writing adds the global attribute *_:Conventions =
"_Coordinates"_*.
