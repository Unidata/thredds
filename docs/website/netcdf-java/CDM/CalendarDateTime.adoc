= CDM Calendar Date Handling

== Overview

As of CDM version 4.3, dates are no longer handled by the http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/[udunits library].
This allows handling {cf}#calendar[non-standard Calendars].
This change only affects *_datetime_* coordinate handling, called {cf}#time-coordinate[time coordinates] in CF.
For all http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis[dimensional units], the udunits package is still used.

=== Definitions

* *_time_* is a duration of time (a dimensional unit).
Udunits handles this using a base unit of "seconds".
All other udunit time units are fixed multiples of a second.
* *_datetime_* is an instant of historical time.
Udunits represents a datetime as a fixed number of seconds since a reference date, eg "12 days since 1990-02-03 12:22".
* *_calendar date_* (eg "1990-02-03 12:22") is a representation of a datetime using calendar fields
(__millisec, second, minute, hour, day, month, year)__.
This allows one to correctly represent the same instant of time that, for example, is printed in a newspaper or is referenced in a history book.
We are following the design from the http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/userguide.html[joda-time library],
which has a very good discussion of the issues in datetime handling software.

== CDM datetime coordinates

The CDM library allows datetime coordinates to be specified in the
following forms:

1.  *link:#udunit[udunit coordinate]:* Variables of any numeric type
(__byte, short, int, long, float, double__) with a _*units*_ attribute
that is a udunit date string, eg "hours since 1930-01-01". This is the
only form that conforms to the {cf}#time-coordinate[current CF spec].
2.  *link:#calendar_field[calendar field coordinate]:* Variables of any
integer type (__byte, short, int, long__) with a _*units*_ attribute
that is a udunit date string but with "calendar" added, eg "calendar
months since 1930-01-01".
3.  *link:#ISO_String[ISO String coordinate]:* Variables of type
_String_ or _char_ in which the values follow (a slightly extended
version of) the W3C profile of ISO 8601.

=== Supported Calendars

CDM supports the following values of the *calendar* attribute, which is attached to the datetime coordinate:

* *gregorian* or *standard* = Mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar. Same as
Udunits except that the dates 1582-10-05 to 1582-10-14 dont exist, nor
does year 0.
* *proleptic_gregorian* or *ISO8601* = A Gregorian calendar extended to
dates before 1582-10-15. This corresponds to the ISO8601 standard. This
is the CDM default.
* *julian* = proleptic Julian calendar system.
* *noleap* or *365_day* = Gregorian calendar without leap years, i.e.,
all years are 365 days long.
* *all_leap* or *366_day* = Gregorian calendar with every year being a
leap year, i.e., all years are 366 days long.
* *uniform30day* or *360_day* = All years are 360 days divided into 30
day months.

The calendar attribute *none* is currently ignored by the CDM, but is
available to the application to process. None of these calendars handle
leap seconds, but with enough effort one could define, eg, a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time[UTC] or
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time[TAI] calendar.

These calendars are implemented in the CDM with classes from Jon
Blower’s *uk.ac.rdg.resc.edal.time* package.

=== Supported Operations

* A *ucar.nc2.time.CalendarDate* object is now used instead of a
**java.util.Date**.
* _CalendarDate.getCalendar()_ retrieves the calendar being used.
* __CalendarDate.isBefore(cdate)__, _CalendarDate.isAfter(cdate)_ allows
comparisions between CalendarDates.
* _CalendarDate.getDifferenceInMsecs(cdate)_ calculates the difference
between CalendarDates.
* A _CalendarDate_ is obtained from a **ucar.nc2.time.CalendarDateUnit
(**instead of a *ucar.units.Unit* or *ucar.nc2.units.DateUnit),* and are
created in classes like **ucar.nc2.datset.CoordinateAxis1DTime**.

== CDM udunit date grammar

The CDM library version 4.3 and after continues to accept udunits for
time coordinate units, but it doesn’t use the udunit library to process
them.

The
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/udunits-2/udunits2lib.html#Grammar[udunit
date grammar] is difficult to understand. Heres an approximate regular
expression:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
period SINCE [-]Y[Y[Y[Y]]]-MM-DD[(T| )hh[:mm[:ss[.sss*]]][ [+|-]hh[[:]mm]]]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following specifies the CDM udunit date grammar:

----
udunitDate     = period SINCE reference_date
period         = "millisec" | "msec" | "second" | "sec" | "s" | "minute" | "min" | "hour" | "hr"
                  | "day" | "week" | "month" | "mon" | "year" | "yr"
period         = period + "s" (plural form)
reference_date = iso8601 formatted date as described below
SINCE          = literal (case insensitive)
----

where

* msec = millisec = seconds / 1000

udunits defines the periods as fixed multiples of seconds. The non-obvious ones are:

* day = 86400.0 seconds
* week = 7 days = 604800.0 seconds
* month = year/12 = 2629743.831225 seconds
* year = 3.15569259747E7 seconds

The udunit package has some other periods that are no longer supported
by CDM udunit date grammar, such as "sidereal day", "lunar month",
"fortnight", "eon", etc. Also CDM doesnt support the full menagerie
of udunit prefixes like "nano", "mega", "kilo", and so on. Contact
us if this is a problem.

CF and CDM agree that one should not use _month_ or _year_ as the period
in a udunit, in order to avoid the following sort of problems:

--------------------------------------------------
 0 months since 1930-01-01 == 1930-01-01T00:00:00Z
 1 months since 1930-01-01 == 1930-01-31T10:29:03Z

90 years since 1850-01-01 == 1940-01-01T19:08:57Z
-------------------------------------------------

=== CDM calendar_field unit grammar

The CDM accepts an extended form of udunit grammar, called a **_calendar
field unit_**:

------------------------------------
CALENDAR period SINCE reference_date
------------------------------------

The presence of "CALENDAR" (case insensitive) means that the CDM
library manipulates the calendar field directly, rather than converting
the period to a fixed multiple of seconds. The actual result depends on
the calendar used. _*Note that values of the period must be an
integer.*_

For example:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 calendar months since 1930-01-01 00:00:00Z == 1930-02-01T00:00:00.000Z
 2 calendar months since 1930-01-01 00:00:00Z == 1930-03-01T00:00:00.000Z
 3 calendar months since 1930-01-01 00:00:00Z == 1930-04-01T00:00:00.000Z
 4 calendar months since 1930-01-01 00:00:00Z == 1930-05-01T00:00:00.000Z
 5 calendar months since 1930-01-01 00:00:00Z == 1930-06-01T00:00:00.000Z
 6 calendar months since 1930-01-01 00:00:00Z == 1930-07-01T00:00:00.000Z
 7 calendar months since 1930-01-01 00:00:00Z == 1930-08-01T00:00:00.000Z
 8 calendar months since 1930-01-01 00:00:00Z == 1930-09-01T00:00:00.000Z
 9 calendar months since 1930-01-01 00:00:00Z == 1930-10-01T00:00:00.000Z
10 calendar months since 1930-01-01 00:00:00Z == 1930-11-01T00:00:00.000Z

== W3C profile of ISO 8601

The CDM uses the http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime.html[W3C profile of
ISO 8601] formatting for reading and writing calendar dates:

____
The formats defined by the W3C profile of ISO 8601 are as follows.
Exactly the components shown here must be present, with exactly this
punctuation. Note that the "T" appears literally in the string, to
indicate the beginning of the time element, as specified in ISO 8601.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Year:
      YYYY (eg 1997)
   Year and month:
      YYYY-MM (eg 1997-07)
   Complete date:
      YYYY-MM-DD (eg 1997-07-16)
   Complete date plus hours and minutes:
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20+01:00)
   Complete date plus hours, minutes and seconds:
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00)
   Complete date plus hours, minutes, seconds and a decimal fraction of a second
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

where:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
     YYYY = four-digit year
     MM   = two-digit month (01=January, etc.)
     DD   = two-digit day of month (01 through 31)
     hh   = two digits of hour (00 through 23) (am/pm NOT allowed)
     mm   = two digits of minute (00 through 59)
     ss   = two digits of second (00 through 59)
     s    = one or more digits representing a decimal fraction of a second
     TZD  = time zone designator (Z or +hh:mm or -hh:mm)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
____

But the CDM also allows the following, for backwards compatibility with udunits:

* You may use a space instead of the `T'
* The year may be preceeded by a `+' (ignored) or a `-' (makes the date BCE)
* The date part uses a `-' delimiter instead of a fixed number of digits for each field
* The time part uses a `:' delimiter instead of a fixed number of digits for each field
* The time zone designator may be Z, UTC, or GMT (case insensitive) or +hh:mm or -hh:mm
* The time zone may be omitted, and then UTC is assumed.

In addition:

* Any fields that are not specified are set to zero.
