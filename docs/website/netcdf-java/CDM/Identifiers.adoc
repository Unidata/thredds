= CDM Identifiers

== Overview

A *_CDM Identifier_* (aka *_CDM Object name_*) refers to the name of a _Group, Dimension, Variable,
Attribute,_ or _EnumTypedef_. A CDM identifier is a variable length sequence of
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode[Unicode] characters. Unicode has
various encodings which are used in different contexts, for example:

* netCDF files store them as a variable length sequence of UTF-8 characters.
* netCDF-Java library internal format is modified UTF-16 in the *java.lang.String* object type.
* netCDF C library internal format is a variable length sequence of UTF-8 characters.

This document summarizes the various encodings. To transform between
them, translate from <form1> to Unicode with <form1> unescaping as needed,
then from Unicode to <form2> with <form2> escaping as needed.

== *netCDF-3 and netCDF-4 file format Identifiers*

*NetCDF C library Object names* refer to the name of a _Group,
Dimension, Variable, Attribute, user-defined Type, compound type
Member,_ or __enumeration type Symbol__.

A netCDF identifier is stored in a netCDF file as
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8[UTF-8]
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode[Unicode] characters,
http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/[NFC normalized]. There are some
restrictions on the valid characters used in a netCDF identifier:

--------------------------------------------------------------
  ID = ([a-zA-Z0-9_]|{MUTF8})([^\x00-\x1F\x2F/\x7F]|{MUTF8})*

where:
  MUTF8 = multibyte UTF8 encoded char
--------------------------------------------------------------

which says:

* The first character of a name must be alphanumeric, a multi-byte UTF-8
character, or the underscore '_' char (reserved for special names with meaning to
implementations, such as the *_FillValue* attribute).
* Subsequent characters may be anything except control characters,
forward slash '/', and del. A UTF-8 multibyte encoding always has the
high order bit set. So the excluded byte values are 0-31, 47, and 127.
* Names that have trailing space characters are also not permitted

See:

* http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/netcdf-4/newdocs/netcdf.html#File-Format[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf/Classic-Format-Spec.html]

== CDL

A link:http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf_utilities_guide.html#cdl_syntax[CDL]
(netCDF Definition Language) document is encoded in UTF-8. Certain
characters must be escaped. The escape mechanism is to prepend a
backslash *"\"* before the character.

Which characters in an identifier must be escaped in CDL?

--------------------------------
[^\x00-\x1F\x7F/_.@+-a-zA-Z0-9]
--------------------------------

Alternatively, we can enumerate the escaped characters (using the
regular expression syntax accepted by lex or flex):

-------------------------------------------
idescaped =[ !"#$%&'()*,:;<=>?\[\\\]^`{|}~]
-------------------------------------------

== NcML

A http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ncml/[NcML] (netCDF Markup
Language) document uses http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#charsets[standard XML
encoding] and escaping.

In an identifier, the chars '&', '<', '>' must be replaced by these
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML#Entity_references[entity references]:
*\&amp;*  *\&lt;* and *\&gt;* respectively.

In some places the single and double quote must be replaced by *\&apos;* and *\&quot;* respectively.

The NetCDF-Java classes will handle this transparently.

== CDM

A CDM object name is a variable length sequence of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode[Unicode] characters.
It can be anything except:

1.  Control chars (< 0x20) are not allowed, these are removed.
2.  Trailing and leading blanks are not allowed and are removed.
3.  a forward slash *"/"* and embedded space are converted into an underscore *"_".*

=== Object Full Name as a String

A CDM object has a *short name* (a String) and a *full name*,
consisting of the parent groups and structures that it belongs to.
Internally, only short names are used, along with the enclosing Group or
Structure objects. So there is generally no problem in comparing or
searching for short names. In certain places in the CDM / NetCDF-Java
library API (eg *_NetcdfFile.findVariable()_*), a full name can be
passed in as a single String, of the form

-------------------------------------------------
groupName/groupName/varName.memberName.memberName
-------------------------------------------------

which uses the "/" and "." as group and structure delimiters,
respectively. In this case, those characters must be escaped in the
object names. Since "/" is not a legal character in an identifier,
that leaves just the "." to be escaped.

=== Object Escaped Name

Standard practice for escaping names is to use *NetcdfFile.escapeName() and NetcdfFile.unescapeName().*
This uses http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backslash[backslash escaping].
The backslash becomes a special char, so it needs to be in the escape set:

-------------
 [\(\),:\.\\]
-------------

Utility routines using this include *Variable.getNameEscaped(),* and **GridDatatype.getNameEscaped()**.


== cdmremote [[cdmremote]]

The client forms requests of the form *_endpoint?query_*, and are sent over HTTP.
The possible query parameters are:

---------------------------------------------------------------
  req=( CDL | NcML | capabilities | header | data)
  var=vars
where:
  vars := varspec | varspec[',' varspec]
  varspec := varname[subsetSpec]
  varname := valid variable name
  subsetSpec := '(' fortran-90 arraySpec ')'

  fortran-90 arraySpec := dim | dim ',' dims
  dim := ':' | slice | start ':' end | start ':' end ':' stride
  slice := INTEGER
  start := INTEGER
  stride := INTEGER
  end := INTEGER
---------------------------------------------------------------

So the characters in variable names that need to be escaped are *',' ':', '(', ')'*
in order to not interfere with this grammer.

=== cdmrFeature

The client forms requests of the form *endpoint?query*. The possible query parameters are:

----------------------------------------------
  req=( capabilities | data | form | stations)
  accept= (csv | xml | ncstream | netcdf )
  time_start,time_end=time range
  north,south,east,west=bounding box
  var=vars
  stn=stns

where:
  vars := varName | varName[,varName]
  stns := stnName | stnName[,stnName]
  varName := valid variable name
  stnName := valid station name
----------------------------------------------

Here we just need to escape the comma *","* in the variable name and in the station names.

== Netcdf Subset Service

It should suffice to URLencode the variable names and station names ,
and to URL decode all the query parameters.

== OPeNDAP

OPeNDAP has an
http://www.opendap.org/pdf/ESE-RFC-004v1.1.pdf[on-the-wire
specification] that must be followed in order to ensure
interoperability. There are two parts to this:

1.  URL encoding
2.  Restriction of identifier names. Since these are different from CDM
object names, there must be a translation between the two. This applies
to identifiers in the URL constraint expression, in the DDS or in the DAS.

=== URL Encoding

OPeNDAP uses standard URL encoding,
akahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding[percent encoding].

=== OPeNDAP identifiers

An OPeNDAP dataset as represented in the CDM library looks like any
other CDM dataset, ie it is not restricted to OPeNDAP encoding. When
making a request over the OPeNDAP protocol, a translation between CDM
and OPeNDAP identifiers must be made.

From the spec:

____
A DAP variable’s name MUST contain ONLY US-ASCII characters with the following additional limitation:
The characters MUST be either upper or lower case letters, numbers or from the set _ ! ~ * ’ - " .
Any other characters MUST be escaped.


To escape a character in a name, the character is replaced by the sequence %<Character Code> where
Character Code is the two hex digit code corresponding to the US-ASCII character.
____

From the OPeNDAP lexers:

-------------------------------------------------------
1. from dds.lex and ce_expr.lex

       [-+a-zA-Z0-9_/%.\\*][-+a-zA-Z0-9_/%.\\#*]*

2. from das.lex

       [-+a-zA-Z0-9_/%.\\*:()][-+a-zA-Z0-9_/%.\\#*:()]*

  (same as dds plus ':','(', and ')' are added)

3. from gse.lex

       [-+a-zA-Z0-9_/%.\\][-+a-zA-Z0-9_/%.\\#]*

  (same as dds except that '*' is removed)
-------------------------------------------------------

Their note: +
____
Note that the DAS allows Identifiers to have parens and colons
while the DDS and expr scanners don’t. It’s too hard to disambiguate
functions when IDs have parens in them and adding colons makes parsing
the array projections hard...
____

=== Making/receiving OPeNDAP requests

Standard practice, then is to translate from CDM identifiers to OPeNDAP
identifiers using *_ucar.nc.util.net.EscapeStrings.escapeDAPIdentifier()_*,
and to translate from OPeNDAP identifiers to CDM identifiers using
*_ucar.nc.util.net.EscapeStrings.unescapeDAPIdentifier()_*.

In addition, HTTPMethod(String URI) automatically adds URL encoding.
These may create a *double escaped* URL. On the server, one first
unescapes the request, and then parses it. Any identifiers in the
request then are unescaped again before comparing with the corresponding
CDM object.

== HDF5

A direct translation of their grammar would appear to be this:

----
PathName={AbsolutePathName}|{RelativePathName}

Separator=[/]+

AbsolutePathName={Separator}{RelativePathName}?

RelativePathName={Component}({Separator}|{RelativePathName})*

Component=[.]|{Name}

Name=[.]|({Charx}{Character}*)|{Character}+

/* Ascii set - '/'
Character={Charx}|[.]

/* Ascii set - '.' and '/' */
Charx=[ !"#$%&'()*+,-0123456789:;<=>?@\[\\\]^`{|}~\x00-\x1e,\x7f]
----

== OGC

The Web Map Service Implementation Specification version 1.3.0 states:

____
*6.3.2 Reserved characters in HTTP GET URLs*

The URL specification (IETF RFC 2396) reserves particular characters as
significant and requires that these be escaped when they might conflict
with their defined usage. This International Standard explicitly
reserves several of those characters for use in the query portion of WMS
requests. When the characters '&', '=', ',' and '+' appear in one of the
roles defined in Table 1, they shall appear literally in the URL. When
those characters appear elsewhere (for example, in the value of a
parameter), they shall be encoded as defined in IETF RFC 2396.
____

*Table 1 – Reserved Characters in WMS Query String*

[cols=",",]
|=======================================================================
|*Character* |*Reserved Usage*

|? |Separator indicating start of query string.

|& |Separator between parameters in query string.

|= |Separator between name and value of parameter.

|, |Separator between individual values in list-oriented parameters
(such as BBOX, LAYERS and STYLES in the GetMap request).

|+ |Shorthand representation for a space character.
|=======================================================================

____
*6.8.2 Parameter lists*
Parameters consisting of lists (for example, BBOX, LAYERS and STYLES in
WMS GetMap) shall use the comma (",") as the separator between items
in the list. Additional white space shall not be used to delimit list
items. If a list item value includes a space or comma, it shall be
escaped using the URL encoding rules (6.3.2 and IETF RFC 2396).
____


== URL encoding

The URL specification [IETF RFC 2396] states that all characters other than:

1.  Reserved characters being used for their defined purpose
2.  Alphanumeric characters
3.  The characters "-", "_", ".", "!", "~", "*", "’", "(", and ")"

shall be encoded as "%xx", where xx is the two hexadecimal digits >
representing the octet code of the character. Within the query string
portion of a URL (i.e., everything after the "?"), the space character
(" ") is an exception, and shall be encoded as a plus sign ("+"). A
server shall be prepared to decode any character encoded in > this
manner.

=== Servlets:

* request.getQueryString() returns raw (undecoded).
* request.getParameter() returns decoded

=== Best Practice:

The query string is always run through *URLDecoder.decode()* before
further processing:
