= CDM Attributes

== _ChunkSize

A Variable Attribute indicating what chunking to use to store the data
in a file. Used when writing netCDF-4 files. When an HDF5/ netCDF-4 is
read, this attribute is added to the variable’s metadata.

== _Compress

A Variable Attribute indicating if compression should be used when
writing the variable. Used when writing netCDF-4 files and for ncstream.
Currently the only valid value of the attribute is *_deflate_*,
indicating to use the deflate compression algorithm.
