== _ChunkSize

in a file. Used when writing netCDF-4 files. When an HDF5/ netCDF-4 is
read, this attribute is added to the variableâ€™s metadata.

writing the variable. Used when writing netCDF-4 files and for ncstream.
Currently the only valid value of the attribute is *_deflate_*,
indicating to use the deflate compression algorithm.
