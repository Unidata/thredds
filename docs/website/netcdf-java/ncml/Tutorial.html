<h1>NcML Tutorial - Basic</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> The NetCDF-Java / CDM library reads many different binary file formats besides netCDF, such as HDF, GRIB, NEXRAD,
  etc, and makes the data accessible through a standard API. It can also read remote datasets through OPeNDAP and
  other remote access protocols. As we will see, by using NcML one can also create virtual datasets by modifying and
  aggregating other datasets. In the general case, we will call any collection of scientific data which can be
  accessed through the NetCDF-Java / CDM library a&nbsp;<em><strong>CDM dataset</strong></em>. </p>

<p>The <em><strong>NetCDF Markup Language (NcML)</strong></em> is an XML dialect that allows you to create CDM datasets.
  An <em><strong>NcML document</strong></em> is an XML document that uses NcML, and defines a CDM dataset. Commonly,
  the NcML document refers to another dataset called the <em><strong>referenced CDM dataset</strong></em>. The purpose
  of NcML is to allow: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Metadata to be added, deleted, and changed.</li>
  <li>Variables to be renamed, added, deleted and restructured.</li>
  <li>Data from multiple CDM files to be combined (aka &quot;aggregated&quot;).</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following, we will use the ToolsUI application to work with NcML datasets. ToolUI is a GUI interface to much
  of the functionality in the CDM library. You may also use a specialized XML editor like Oxygen or XML Spy, or an IDE
  like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or NetBeans that have context-sensitive XML editing. </p>

<p>For these exercises, you should <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/v4.6/webstart/netCDFtools.jnlp">run ToolsUI from
  webstart</a> or <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf-java/">download the ToolsUI
  application</a> and run it locally from the jar. </p>

<p>Use the ToolsUI <strong>NcML Tab</strong> to generate NcML from the CDM file by entering the the URL of a local or remote
  CDM dataset, or browse <img src="images/Browse.jpg" alt="Browse" width="32" height="32">to a local file. The NcML of
  the dataset is generated and displayed: </p>

<p><img src="images/ncmlTab.png" alt="" width="961" height="510"></p>

<p>Entering a file that ends with <strong>xml</strong> or <strong>ncml</strong> simply displays the NcML file directly.</p>

<h2>Exercise 1. Working with NcML files in ToolsUI</h2>

<p>Download <a href="examples/example1.nc">example1.nc</a> and <a href="examples/exercise1.ncml">exercise1.ncml</a> and
  place them in the same directory. Open <strong>exercise1.ncml</strong> in the in the NcML tab:</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
    &lt;netcdf xmlns=&quot;http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2&quot;  location=&quot;example1.nc&quot;&gt;
<br>  &lt;dimension name=&quot;time&quot; length=&quot;2&quot; isUnlimited=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;<br>  &lt;dimension name=&quot;lat&quot; length=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;<br>  &lt;dimension name=&quot;lon&quot; length=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
<br>  &lt;attribute name=&quot;title&quot; type=&quot;String&quot; value=&quot;Example Data&quot; /&gt;
<br>  &lt;variable name=&quot;rh&quot; shape=&quot;time lat lon&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;<br>    &lt;attribute name=&quot;long_name&quot; type=&quot;String&quot; value=&quot;relative humidity&quot; /&gt;<br>    &lt;attribute name=&quot;units&quot; type=&quot;String&quot; value=&quot;percent&quot; /&gt;<br>  &lt;/variable&gt;
<br>  &lt;variable name=&quot;T&quot; shape=&quot;time lat lon&quot; type=&quot;double&quot;&gt;<br>    &lt;attribute name=&quot;long_name&quot; type=&quot;String&quot; value=&quot;surface temperature&quot; /&gt;<br>    &lt;attribute name=&quot;units&quot; type=&quot;String&quot; value=&quot;C&quot; /&gt;<br>  &lt;/variable&gt;
<br>  &lt;variable name=&quot;lat&quot; shape=&quot;lat&quot; type=&quot;float&quot;&gt;<br>    &lt;attribute name=&quot;units&quot; type=&quot;String&quot; value=&quot;degrees_north&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;values&gt;41.0 40.0 39.0&lt;/values&gt;<br>  &lt;/variable&gt;
<br>  &lt;variable name=&quot;lon&quot; shape=&quot;lon&quot; type=&quot;float&quot;&gt;<br>    &lt;attribute name=&quot;units&quot; type=&quot;String&quot; value=&quot;degrees_east&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;values&gt;-109.0 -107.0 -105.0 -103.0&lt;/values&gt;<br>  &lt;/variable&gt;
<br>  &lt;variable name=&quot;time&quot; shape=&quot;time&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;<br>    &lt;attribute name=&quot;units&quot; type=&quot;String&quot; value=&quot;hours&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;values&gt;6 18&lt;/values&gt;<br>  &lt;/variable&gt;<br>&lt;/netcdf&gt;
</pre>

<p>In this example, data for the <strong>lat</strong>, <strong>lon</strong> and <strong>time</strong> coordinate variables comes
  from the NcML document, while the data for the <strong>rh</strong> and <strong>T</strong> variables
  will be obtained from the referenced dataset <em>example1.nc.</em></p>

<p>Open <strong>exercise1.ncml</strong> in the ToolsUI <strong>NCDump</strong> Tab. This creates the following NetCDF
  Dataset, in CDL notation:</p>
<pre>netcdf file:C:/temp/exercise1.ncml {<br>
 dimensions:<br>  time = UNLIMITED;   // (2 currently)  <br>  lat = 3;   <br>  lon = 4;   <br>
 variables:<br>  int rh(time, lat, lon);<br>   :long_name = &quot;relative humidity&quot;;<br>   :units = &quot;percent&quot;;<br>  double T(time, lat, lon);<br>   :long_name = &quot;surface temperature&quot;;<br>   :units = &quot;C&quot;;<br>  float lat(lat);<br>   :units = &quot;degrees_north&quot;;<br>  float lon(lon);<br>   :units = &quot;degrees_east&quot;;<br>  int time(time);<br>   :units = &quot;hours&quot;;
        // Global Attributes:<br> :title = &quot;Example Data&quot;;</p><p> data:<br> lat = 41.0, 40.0, 39.0;<br> lon =
    -109.0, -107.0, -105.0, -103.0;<br> time = 6, 18;
    }
</pre>
Note that the name of the dataset is the name of the NcML file, not the referenced dataset.
<p>Allowable forms of the referenced dataset location are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>an absolute HTTP URL (eg <strong>http://server/myfile.nc</strong>)</li>
  <li>An absolute file URL with an absolute path (eg <strong>file:/usr/local/data/mine.nc</strong>). You can sometimes
    omit the <strong>file:</strong> prefix, but not always, so we recommend using the <strong>file:</strong> prefix.
  </li>
  <li>An absolute file URL with a relative path (eg <strong>file:data/mine.nc</strong>). The file will be opened
    relative to the working directory.
  </li>
  <li> A relative URL resolved against the NcML location (eg <strong>subdir/mydata.nc</strong>). You must
    <strong>not</strong> use a <em>file:</em> prefix in this case. This is what we are using in this example, since
    the data file is in the same directory as the NcML file.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Open <strong>exercise1.ncml</strong> in the in the ToolsUI <strong>Viewer</strong> tab: Select a variable by left
  clicking on it, then right click to get the context menu.</p>

<p><img src="images/Viewer.png" alt="Viewer" width="1074" height="297"></p>

<p>From the context menu, select <strong>NCdump Data</strong>, which brings up a popup window. Click the
  <strong>NCdump</strong> button to show the variable's data:</p>
<img src="images/NCdumpPanel.png" alt="NCdumpPanel">

<p>The expression <strong>T(0:1:1, 0:2:1, 0:3:1) </strong>shows the limits of the T variable's data array in <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_slicing#1992:_Fortran_90_and_above">Fortran 90 notation</a>. For
  example, <strong>0:3:1</strong> means that the index starts at 0, ends at 3 (inclusive) with stride 1. You can use a
  single value to <em><strong>slice</strong></em> at that index, eg <strong>T(1, 0:2:1, 0:3:1)</strong> means to show
  the T array for index=1 on the first (time) dimension. For large data arrays, it is often useful to edit this
  expression, especially the stride, to examine subsets of the data.</p>

<p>Repeat this for other variables to familiarize yourself with examining data values. </p>

<h2>Exercise 2. Generate NcML from CDM file</h2>

<p>In the ToolsUI <strong>NcML Tab</strong>, browse to your data directory and open the data file
  <strong>example1.nc</strong> directly (not the NcML file <strong>exercise1.ncml)</strong>. The NcML is generated
  directly from the CDM file itself:</p>

<p><img src="images/Exercise2.png" alt="Exercise2" width="870" height="570"></p>

<p>Since this NcML is generated from the file itself, it is equivalent to just naming the file and allowing all of the
  metadata to be taken from it:</p>
<pre>&lt;netcdf xmlns=&quot;http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2&quot; location=&quot;C:/temp/example1.nc&quot;&gt;</pre>
<p>This form is useful in aggregations but not for much else.</p>

<h2>Exercise 3. Read in metadata from existing NetCDF file and modify<a name="modify"></a>:</h2>

<p>In this example, we read in all of the metadata from the referenced dataset, and modify it
  through elements in the NcML.</p>

<p>Download <a href="examples/exercise3.ncml">exercise3.ncml</a> and place it in the same directory as example1.nc. Open
  exercise3.ncml in the ToolsUI Viewer tab, and in the NcML tab.</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br>&lt;netcdf xmlns=&quot;http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2&quot; location=&quot;example1.nc&quot;&gt;
<br><strong>(1)</strong>&lt;attribute name=&quot;title&quot; type=&quot;String&quot; value=&quot;Example Data using CF&quot; /&gt;
<strong>(2)</strong>&lt;attribute name=&quot;Conventions&quot; value=&quot;CF-1.0&quot; /&gt;
<br><strong>(3)</strong>&lt;variable name=&quot;RelativeHumidity&quot; orgName=&quot;rh&quot;&gt;<br>(<strong>4)</strong>  &lt;attribute name=&quot;standard_name&quot; type=&quot;String&quot; value=&quot;relative humidity&quot; /&gt;<br>   &lt;/variable&gt;
<br>   &lt;variable name=&quot;T&quot;&gt;<br><strong>(5) </strong> &lt;attribute name=&quot;standard_name&quot; type=&quot;String&quot; value=&quot;temperature&quot; /&gt;<br><strong>(6) </strong> &lt;attribute name=&quot;units&quot; type=&quot;String&quot; value=&quot;degreesC&quot; /&gt;<br>   &lt;/variable&gt;
<strong>(7)</strong>&lt;variable name=&quot;deltaLat&quot; type=&quot;double&quot; shape=&quot;lat&quot;&gt;
     &lt;values&gt;.1 .1 .01&lt;/values&gt;
   &lt;/variable&gt;
<br>&lt;/netcdf&gt;</pre>
<ol>
  <li>The global attribute named &quot;title&quot; is given a new value.</li>
  <li>
    A global attribute named &quot;Conventions&quot; is added.
  </li>
  <li>The variable &quot;rh&quot; is renamed to &quot;RelativeHumidity&quot;</li>
  <li>A variable attribute &quot;standard_name&quot; is added</li>
  <li>A variable attribute &quot;standard_name&quot; is added</li>
  <li>The variable attribute &quot;units&quot; is given a new value.</li>
  <li>A new variable is &quot;deltaLat&quot; added. Since it doesn't exist in the referenced dataset, you must also
    define its data values.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>This creates the following NetCDF Dataset. </p>
<pre>netcdf file:C:/temp/exercise3.ncml {
  dimensions:
   time = UNLIMITED;   // (2 currently)
   lat = 3;
   lon = 4;
 
  variables:
   int RelativeHumidity(time=2, lat=3, lon=4);
     :long_name = &quot;relative humidity&quot;;
     :units = &quot;percent&quot;;
     :standard_name = &quot;relative humidity&quot;;
   double T(time=2, lat=3, lon=4);
     :long_name = &quot;surface temperature&quot;;
     :units = &quot;degreesC&quot;;
     :standard_name = &quot;temperature&quot;;
   float lat(lat=3);
     :units = &quot;degrees_north&quot;;
   float lon(lon=4);
     :units = &quot;degrees_east&quot;;
   int time(time=2);
     :units = &quot;hours&quot;;
   double deltaLat(lat=3);

 :title = &quot;Example Data using CF&quot;;
 :Conventions = &quot;CF-1.0&quot;;
}
</pre>
<p>Using NcML in this way to modify the contents of a CDM dataset is a kind of <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming">declarative programming.</a> We say that the NcML
  <em><strong>wraps</strong></em> the referenced dataset. Note that you can't tell what the resulting dataset looks
  like without also examining the referenced dataset. If one adds an <strong>&lt;explicit/&gt;</strong> element to the
  NcML, then the metadata in the referenced dataset is not read in, the result dataset is defined entirely by whats in
  the NcML, and the referenced dataset is only used for data values. However in practice <strong>
    &lt;explicit/&gt;</strong> is not used much.</p>

<h2>Exercise 4. Other ToolsUI features</h2>

<h3>Modify and Save</h3>

<p>A typical scenario is to modify an existing dataset with NcML, save the NcML, and use it instead of the original
  dataset.</p>

<p>In the ToolsUI <strong>NcML Tab</strong>, browse to your data directory and again open the data file <strong>example1.nc</strong>
  directly. The NcML is generated and displayed. Make some simple modifications, changing an attribute value or adding
  a new attribute. Save the NcML to disk <img align="middle" src="images/Save.jpg" alt="" width="32" height="32">. Note that the
  default NcML filename will be the original file name with the extension changed to <strong>ncml</strong>. Save the
  NcML to <em>example1.ncml</em>. </p>

<p>In the ToolsUI <strong>Viewer Tab</strong>, open <strong>example1.ncml</strong> and examine it. Does it look like what
  you expect? Try making different kinds of mistakes to see what error messages (if any) that you get. By switching
  between the Viewer tab and the NcML tab, you can quickly try out different things.</p>
<ul>
  <li>create malformed XML by leaving off a closing element bracket</li>
  <li>misspell an element name, eg <em>&lt;atribute&gt;</em> instead of <em>&lt;attribute&gt;</em></li>
  <li>change the <em>name</em> of an existing attribute, and examine the resulting dataset to see what happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>The NcML tab offers no error checking, its really just a text editor. You may find XML-aware editors very useful for
  finding syntax mistakes in your NcML.</p>

<h3>Writing out files modified with NcML</h3>

<p>You can generate a NetCDF-3 file from an NcML file, and the equivalent binary NetCDF file will be created with all
  the original data copied to it. Since the binary data is taken from the original file, this is an efficient way to
  make a copy, even for large files. In the ToolsUI <strong>NcML Tab</strong>, bring up an NcML file that doesn't have any mistakes in it. Generate a
  NetCDF-3 file from the NcML <img src="images/WriteNetcdf.jpg" alt="" width="32" height="32">, saving it to some new
  and uniquely named file. Now bring up that file in the ToolsUI <strong>Viewer Tab</strong> and examine it. It should
  be identical to the NcML file that generated it.</p>

<p>This feature works as long as you are using only netCDF-3 compatible features (aka netCDF classic model). In practice
  this mostly means no Structures or Groups. Strings are ok, and are converted to type char. The equivalent Java code
  to do this is: </p>
<pre>NetcdfDataset ncfileIn = NcMLReader.readNcML (ncml_filename, null);
FileWriter2 writer = new ucar.nc2.FileWriter2(ncfileIn, locationOut, NetcdfFileWriter.Version.netcdf3, null);
NetcdfFile ncfileOut = writer.write(null);
ncfileOut.close();
ncfileIn.close();
