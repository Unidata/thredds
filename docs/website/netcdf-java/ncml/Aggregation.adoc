= NcML Aggregation

== Introduction

Multiple CDM datasets can be aggregated into a single, logical dataset.
This is done with the *_aggregation_* NcML element. There are several types of aggregation:

1.  **link:#Union[Union]**: The union of all the dimensions, attributes,
and variables in multiple NetCDF files.
2.  **link:#joinExisting[JoinExisting]**: Variables of the same name (in
different files) are connected along their existing, outer dimension,
called the __aggregation dimension__. A coordinate variable must exist
for the dimension.
3.  **link:#joinNew[JoinNew]**: Variables of the same name (in different
files) are connected along a new outer dimension. Each file becomes one
. A new coordinate variable is created for the dimension.
4.  <<FmrcAggregation#,*ForecastModelRunCollection*>> (FMRC): A
collection of forecast model runs with two time coordinates: a _*run
time*_ and a __*forecast time*__.

== Exercise 1: Union of NetCDF files

Download link:examples/aggUnionSimple.ncml[aggUnionSimple.ncml],
link:examples/cldc.mean.nc[cldc.mean.nc]
and link:examples/lflx.mean.nc[lflx.mean.nc] and place them together in a
single directory. In the ToolsUI **NcML Tab**, open
*aggUnionSimple.ncml* and examine it:

[source,xml]
----
<netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
  <attribute name="title" type="string" value="Union cldc and lflx"/>
  <aggregation type="union">
    <netcdf location="cldc.mean.nc"/>
    <netcdf location="lflx.mean.nc"/>
  </aggregation>
</netcdf>
----

This NcML constructs a dataset by creating the union of two netCDF files
(note there is no _location_ attribute in the outer netcdf element).

Go to the NcML/Aggregation Tab of ToolsUI and cut and paste the full
path of the *aggUnionSimple.ncml* file:

image:images/aggUnionSimple.png[image]

The files that comprise the aggregation are listed in the top table,
various information about the aggregation is listed in the lower pane.
Select one of the files, and right click to bring up the context menu.
Choose "Open as NetCDF File" so that you can look at the contents of
that file. You can open the nested files in the Viewer **NCDump
image:images/NCDump.png[image]**. They look like the following (details
omitted):

----
netcdf cldc.mean.nc {
  dimensions:
   time = UNLIMITED;   // (456 currently)
   lat = 21;
   lon = 360;
 variables:
   float lat(lat=21);
   float lon(lon=360);
   double time(time=456);
   short cldc(time=456, lat=21, lon=360);
}

netcdf lflx.mean.nc {
  dimensions:
   time = UNLIMITED;   // (456 currently)
   lat = 21;
   lon = 360;
 variables:
   float lat(lat=21);
   float lon(lon=360);
   double time(time=456);
   short lflx(time=456, lat=21, lon=360);
}
----

In the ToolsUI **Viewer Tab**, open *aggUnionSimple.ncml* and examine
it:

----
netcdf aggUnionSimple.xml {
  dimensions:
     time = UNLIMITED;   // (456 currently)
     lat = 21;
        lon = 360;
  variables:
     float lat(lat=21);
        float lon(lon=360);
        double time(time=456);

     short cldc(time=456, lat=21, lon=360);
     short lflx(time=456, lat=21, lon=360);
}
----

The *cldc* variable will be read from __cldc.mean.nc__, while the *lflx*
variable will be read from _lflx.mean.nc._ All the other variables,
dimensions, and attributes are taken from the first file that declares
them.

_A *Union* dataset is constructed by transferring objects (dimensions,
attributes, groups, and variables) from the nested datasets in the order
the nested datasets are listed. If an object with the same name already
exists, it is skipped._ *_You need to pay close attention to dimensions
and coordinate variables, which must match exactly across nested
files._*

== Exercise 2: Aggregation on an existing dimension

Download link:examples/aggExisting.ncml[aggExisting.ncml],
link:examples/jan.nc[jan.nc] and link:examples/feb.nc[feb.nc] and place
them together in a single directory. In the ToolsUI **NcML Tab**, open
*aggExisting.ncml* and examine it:

This NcML constructs a dataset by declaring "time" the **_aggregation
dimension_**. Any variable that has that dimension as its outer
dimension is an **_aggregation variable_**. The dimension must be the
outer (slowest varying) dimension. There must be an existing coordinate
variable named time.

[source,xml]
----
<netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
  <aggregation dimName="time" type="joinExisting">
    <netcdf location="jan.nc" />
    <netcdf location="feb.nc" />
  </aggregation>
</netcdf>
----

Go to the NcML/Aggregation Tab of ToolsUI and cut and paste the full
path of the *aggExisting.ncml* file:

image:images/aggExisting.png[image]

In the lower pane, you can see the list of variables that will be
aggregated (P,T,time) and that the first 31 indices come from
**jan.nc**, and the next 28 from **feb.nc**.

Open the nested files in the ToolsUI **NCDump Tab**. They look like the
following (details omitted):

----
netcdf jan.nc {
   dimensions:
     lat = 3;
     lon = 4;
     time = 31;
   variables:
     double P(time=31, lat=3, lon=4);
     double T(time=31, lat=3, lon=4);
     float lat(lat=3);
     float lon(lon=4);
     int time(time=31);
 }

netcdf feb.nc {
   dimensions:
     lat = 3;
     lon = 4;
     time = 28;
   variables:
     double P(time=28, lat=3, lon=4);
     double T(time=28, lat=3, lon=4);
     float lat(lat=3);
     float lon(lon=4);
     int time(time=28);
 }
----

In the ToolsUI **Viewer Tab**, open *aggExisting.ncml* and examine it
using the NCDumpData icon located on the toolbar:

----
netcdf aggExisting.xml {
   dimensions:
     lat = 3;
     lon = 4;
     time = 59;
   variables:
     double P(time=59, lat=3, lon=4);
     double T(time=59, lat=3, lon=4);
     float lat(lat=3);
     float lon(lon=4);
     int time(time=59);
 }
----

The variables *P, T,* and *time* are aggregation variables, because they
have the aggregation dimension as their first (outermost) dimension. The
first 31 data values are taken from the file _jan.nc_ and the next 28
data values are taken from __feb.nc__. All the other variables,
dimensions, and attributes are taken from the first file that declares
them.

_A *JoinExisting* dataset is constructed by transferring objects
(dimensions, attributes, groups, and variables) from the nested datasets
in the order the nested datasets are listed. All variables that use the
aggregation dimension as their outer dimension are logically
concatenated, in the order of the nested datasets. Variables that don’t
use the aggregation dimension are treated as in a Union dataset, i.e.
skipped if one with that name already exists._

=== Specify number of coordinates

When the library opens the above NcML dataset, it has to read through
all nested datasets, in order to find out the length of the time
dimension. For large aggregations, this can be slow. In the example
below, we have added the optional _ncoords_ attribute on the nested
datasets. In this case, only one dataset has to be opened immediately,
and the others as needed for a data read request.

[source,xml]
----
<netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
  <aggregation dimName="time" type="joinExisting">
    <netcdf location="file:/test/temperature/jan.nc" ncoords="31"/>
    <netcdf location="file:/test/temperature/feb.nc" ncoords="28"/>
  </aggregation>
</netcdf>
----

=== Defining coordinates on a JoinExisting aggregation

Typically the coordinates for a _*JoinExisting*_ aggregation are taken
from the existing coordinate variable, as in the above example. If the
coordinate is missing, you must define it in the NcML:

[source,xml]
----
 <netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
(1)<variable name="time" shape="time" type="int">
     <attribute name="units" value="days since 2000-01-01"/>
     <attribute name="_CoordinateAxisType" value="Time" />
(2)  <values start="0" increment="1" />
   </variable>

  <aggregation dimName="time" type="joinExisting">
    <netcdf location="file:/test/temperature/jan.nc" ncoords="31"/>
    <netcdf location="file:/test/temperature/feb.nc" ncoords="28"/>
  </aggregation>
 </netcdf>
----

1.  A coordinate variable is defined for the aggregation dimension. If
it doesn’t exist in the nested datasets, you must define its shape and
type.
2.  The values are specified as regularly spaced.

These are the ways that coordinate values may be assigned to a
*JoinExisting* coordinate:

1.  You may explicitly define the coordinate variable in the NcML, and
assign coordinate values to it, as in this example. These will override
anything in the nested datasets. If you explicitly list the values, you
must know the exact number of them. If you use the start and increment
values, as in this example, you don’t have to know the exact number, but
the values must be evenly spaced.
2.  You may explicitly define the coordinate variable, but not specify
its values, which allows you to define attributes for the coordinate
variable. The coordinate values will be read from the the nested
*netcdf* dataset coordinate variables
3.  You may specify the coordinate values through the _coordValue_
attributes on the individual _netcdf_ elements, with the correct number
of space-delimited coordinate values, eg:
+
[source,xml]
----
<aggregation dimName="time" type="joinExisting">
  <netcdf location="file:/test/temperature/janAvgWeek.nc" coordValue="1038 7823 12983 43400"/>
  <netcdf location="file:/test/temperature/febAvgWeek.nc" coordValue="66234 89237 108736 123494"/>
</aggregation>
----
4.  If there is exactly one time slice in each file of the
*JoinExisting* aggregation, and you are using a link:#scan[scan] element
to dynamically scan the files in a directory, then you can use the
link:#dateFormatMark[dateFormatMark] attribute to derive the date from
the filename.
5.  If you do not specify a coordinate variable, one must exist in each
of the nested datasets, and the coordinate values will be read from it,
just like any other aggregation variable. In this case, _*when the units
of the aggregation coordinate change on the existing coordinate
variables, you must add*_ *timeUnitsChange="true"* _*on the
aggregation element:*_

[source,xml]
----
<aggregation dimName="time" type="joinExisting" timeUnitsChange="true">
  <netcdf location="file:/test/temperature/janAvgWeek.nc" />
  <netcdf location="file:/test/temperature/febAvgWeek.nc" />
</aggregation>
----

The *timeUnitsChange* feature requires that all the aggregation
coordinate values will be read in when the dataset is opened.

== Exercise 3: Aggregation on a new dimension

The previous example "joined" variables along their existing outer
dimension. Another common case is to aggregate variables by creating a
new outer dimension. Each existing variable becomes one "slice" of the
compound variable (a _slice_ holds the index of one dimension constant,
e.g. **humidity(3,:,:,:)**). The following NcML joins variables from
three separate files into a single variable, by creating a new dimension
of length 3:

Download link:examples/aggNew.ncml[aggNew.ncml],
link:examples/time0.nc[time0.nc,] link:examples/time1.nc[time1.nc]
and link:examples/time2.nc[time2.nc] and place them together in a single
directory. In the ToolsUI **NcML Tab**, open *aggNew.ncml* and examine
it:

[source,xml]
----
<netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
(1)<aggregation dimName="time" type="joinNew">
(2)  <variableAgg name="T"/>
(3)  <netcdf location="time0.nc" coordValue="0"/>
     <netcdf location="time1.nc" coordValue="10"/>
     <netcdf location="time2.nc" coordValue="99"/>
   </aggregation>
</netcdf>
----

1.  The aggregation is defined as type *_joinNew_* on the *_time_* dimension.
2.  The variable named *_T_* will be made into aggregation variable; you can list as many variables as needed.
3.  The list of files to use, in order. Each one has a coordinate value
assigned to it, whose type must be compatible with the coordinate
variable type, if you have created one.

Go to the NcML/Aggregation Tab of ToolsUI and cut and paste the full path of the *aggNew.ncml* file:

image:images/aggNew.png[image]

Open the nested files in the ToolsUI **NCDump Tab**. They all look like
the following (details omitted):

----
netcdf time0.nc {
 dimensions:
   lat = 3;
   lon = 4;
 variables:
   double T(lat=3, lon=4);
   float lat(lat=3);
   float lon(lon=4);
}
----

This will create the following dataset:

----
netcdf file:C:/dev/tds/thredds/docs/web/netcdf-java/ncml/examples/aggNew.ncml {
 dimensions:
   lat = 3;
   lon = 4;
   time = 3;
 variables:
   float lat(lat=3);
   float lon(lon=4);
   int time(time=3);
   double T(time=3, lat=3, lon=4);
 data:
    time = {0, 10, 99}
 }
----

So a new dimension and coordinate variable _time(time)_ has been
added, and the aggregation variable T now has time as its outer
dimension. The data for T from the nested files are logically
concatenated together.

_A *JoinNew* dataset is constructed by transferring objects (dimensions,
attributes, groups, and variables) from the nested datasets in the order
the nested datasets are listed. All variables that are listed as
aggregation variables are logically concatenated along the new
dimension, in the order of the nested datasets. A coordinate Variable is
created for the new dimension. Non-aggregation variables are treated as
in a Union dataset, i.e. skipped if one of that name already exists._

=== Defining coordinates on a JoinNew aggregation

A *_JoinNew_* aggregation has to create a new coordinate variable. In
the above example, one was automatically created with type double, to
match the coordValues specified on the netcdf elements. However, it has
no units or other attributes. To specify attributes on the coordinate
system, you can use the following (download
link:examples/aggNewCoord.ncml[aggNewCoord.ncml]):

[source,xml]
----
<netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
(1)<variable name="time" type="int" >
     <attribute name="units" value="months since 2000-6-16 6:00"/>
     <attribute name="_CoordinateAxisType" value="Time" />
     <values>0 1 2</values>
   </variable>
(2)<aggregation dimName="time" type="joinNew">
   <variableAgg name="T"/>
   <netcdf location="time0.nc" />
    <netcdf location="time1.nc" />
    <netcdf location="time2.nc" />
   </aggregation>

</netcdf>
----

Its not obvious from the NcML, but the aggregation element *(2)* is
processed first, so that all of the objects of the aggregated datasets
are available to be modified by other NcML elements, for example by
**(1)**.

This will create the following dataset:

----
netcdf file:C:/dev/tds/thredds/docs/web/netcdf-java/ncml/examples/aggNew.ncml {
 dimensions:
   lat = 3;
   lon = 4;
   time = 3;
 variables:
   float lat(lat=3);
   float lon(lon=4);
   int time(time=3;)
     :units = "months since 2000-6-16 6:00";
     :_CoordinateAxisType = "Time";
   double T(time=3, lat=3, lon=4);
 data:
   time = {0, 1, 2}
 }
----

There are several ways that coordinate values are assigned to a JoinNew
coordinate:

1.  If the dataset has an existing **scalar** variable that matches the
name of the new dimension, the values of this variable will be used as
coordinate values.
2.  You may explicitly specify the coordinate variable, and assign
coordinate values to it, as in this example.
3.  You may explicitly specify the coordinate variable, but specify the
coordinate values through the _coordValue_ attributes on the individual
_netcdf_ elements, as in the first example.
4.  If you do not specify a coordinate variable, but you add
_coordValue_ attributes to the individual _netcdf_ elements, then a
coordinate variable of type double or String will be added.
5.  If you do not specify a coordinate variable, and you do not add
_coordValue_ attributes, then a coordinate variable of type String will
be added whose values are the names of the files.

Note that you must explicitly specify the coordinate variable in order
to assign attributes to it, which is something you are likely to need to
do when creating a new coordinate variable; for example defining a unit
attribute is usually necessary.
Assigning the *_CoordinateAxisType* type is one way to make sure that the
<<../reference/CoordinateAttributes#CoordinateAttributes,Coordinate
layer>> correctly identifies the coordinate type. Using CF Conventions is strongly recommended.

Also note that, contrary to previous versions of NcML aggregation, you
do *not* need to define a dimension element for the aggregation
dimension (e.g. <dimension name="time"> and *must not* use the old
form _<dimension name="time" length="0" />_ as it will override the dimension created by the aggregation.

_For all aggregations, the aggregation element is processed first, so
that the objects (dimensions, attributes, groups, and variables) from
the nested datasets exist and can be modified by other NcML elements._

== Exercise 4: Aggregation by scanning a directory

Its often convenient to use all the files in some directory without
having to name them individually. The following example scans all of the
files in the directory _/data/model_ (and its subdirectories) which end
in *".nc".* By default, the files are ordered by sorting on the filename.

[source,xml]
----
<netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
  <aggregation dimName="time" type="joinExisting">
    <scan location="/data/model/" suffix=".nc" />
  </aggregation>
</netcdf>
----

When opening a *joinExisting* aggregation using a *scan* element, each
matching file must be opened in order to determine its size. This can be
slow if there are a large number of files. In the case where you specify
the files individually, you could add the *ncoords* attribute for speed.
In the THREDDS Data Server, the information is cached, so that
subsequent requests do not need to open each file until data is
requested. However, see the section on link:#caching[caching].

A *joinNew* type aggregation does not incur this expense, since there is
always exactly one step per file:

[source,xml]
----
<netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
  <aggregation dimName="time" type="joinNew">
    <variableAgg name="T"/>
    <scan location="/data/goes/" suffix=".gini" />
  </aggregation>
</netcdf>
----

In a joinNew aggregation, the problem is how to assign coordinate values
to each step? If you do nothing, a String-valued coordinate variable
will be defined, whose values are the filenames. Better is to specify
the coordinate variable and assign it values:

[source,xml]
----
<netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
  <variable name="time" type="int" shape="time" >
    <attribute name="units" value="hours since 2000-01-01 00:00"/>
    <attribute name="_CoordinateAxisType" value="Time" />
       <values start="0" increment="1" />
  </variable>
  <aggregation dimName="time" type="joinNew">
    <variableAgg name="T"/>
    <scan location="/data/goes/" suffix=".gini" />
  </aggregation>
</netcdf>
----

You can also explicitly list the values:

----
  <values>12.0 27.0 39.0 51.0</values>
----

If the values are evenly spaced, you can use the start/increment form,
and you don’t need to know the number of files:

----
 <values start="12.0" increment="25.0"/>
----

=== Extracting date coordinates from the filename

For the common case that the filename contains date information from
which you can derive a time coordinate, you can use the *dateFormatMark*
attribute (download link:examples/aggDateFormat.ncml[aggDateFormat.ncml]
and link:examples/cg.zip[cg.zip], unzip the latter and place in your
data directory). In the ToolsUI **NcML Tab**, open *aggDateFormat.ncml*
and change the scan location to point to your data directory, and then
save it image:images/saveButt.png[image]:

[source,xml]
----
<netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
  <aggregation dimName="time" type="joinExisting" recheckEvery="4 sec">
    <scan location="CHANGE
  THIS" dateFormatMark="CG#yyyyDDD_HHmmss" suffix=".nc" subdirs="false" />
  </aggregation>
</netcdf>
----

The *_dateFormatMark_* attribute is used on *joinNew* aggregation, as
well as *joinExisting* if there is only one time slice in each file, to
create date coordinate values out of the filename. It consists of a
section of text, a `#' marking character, then a
<<AnnotatedSchema4#SimpleDateFormat,*java.text.SimpleDateFormat*>>
string. The number of characters before the # is skipped in the
filename, then the next part of the filename must match the
SimpleDateFormat string, then it ignores any trailing text. For example:

----
      Filename: CG2006158_120000h_usfc.nc
DateFormatMark: CG#yyyyDDD_HHmmss
----

The net effect is to add a coordinate variable, whose values are ISO
8601 formatted date/time Strings, with a *_CoordinateAxisType* of
"Time", so the example NcML will show this (details skipped):

----
netcdf file:C:/dev/tds/thredds/cdm/src/test/data/ncml/aggExistingOne.xml {
 dimensions:
   altitude = 1;
   lat = 29;
   lon = 26;
   time = 3;
 variables:
   float altitude(altitude=1);
   float lat(lat=29);
   float lon(lon=26);
   float CGusfc(time=3, altitude=1, lat=29, lon=26);

   String time(time=3);
     :_CoordinateAxisType = "Time";
     :long_name = "time coordinate";
     :standard_name = "time";
 data:
   time =  "2006-06-07T12:00:00Z",   "2006-06-07T13:00:00Z",   "2006-06-07T14:00:00Z"
}
----

_The *scan* element allows you to specify that all of the files in a
directory (and its subdirectories, with an optional suffix filter) are
included in the aggregation. The files are sorted alphabetically on the
filename, unless you specify a *dateFormatMark* attribute, in which case
they are sorted by the Date derived from the filename, which is also
used for the coordinate values._

== Aggregation on dynamic sets of files

When you use a scan element to define a collection of files, the case
where the set of files may change as new files are added or deleted
requires special attention.

1.  Each time you open the NcML dataset, a "snapshot" of the directory
is made, and the dataset will not change for the lifetime of the
NetcdfDataset object, that is, until you close it. If component files
are deleted, and you try to access their data, you will get a
__java.io.FileNotFoundException__. Files that are added will not be
seen.

There are situations where you need to indicate how often the directories should be rescanned.

1.  If you have enabled caching (using *NetcdfFileCache* and
*NetcdfDatasetCache*), and you are getting the dataset through
NetcdfDataset.acquire(), then when the NcML file is acquired, the
directories will be re-scanned if *recheckEvery* time has passed since
it was last scanned. The _recheckEvery_ attribute only applies
when using a scan element.
2.  The TDS Server uses caching, so when defining aggregations, you
should always include a *recheckEvery* time for any dataset that can
change.

You indicate how often the directories should be rescanned using the *recheckEvery* attribute:

[source,xml]
----
<netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
  <aggregation dimName="time" type="joinNew" recheckEvery="15 min" >
    <variableAgg name="T"/>
    <scan location="/data/goes/" suffix=".gini" />
  </aggregation>
</netcdf>
----

The value of *recheckEvery* must be a
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/[udunit] time unit, e.g.
uses units of __sec, min, hour, day__, etc. If you do not specify a
recheckEvery attribute, the collection will be assumed to be
non-changing.

_When using the *scan* element on directories whose contents may change,
you must use a *recheckEvery* attribute. It specifies the maximum time
before changes will be detected by a newly opened NcML dataset. An
existing NcML dataset will not notice the changes, and you can get
FileNotFoundException if the component files are deleted._

_Note that the *recheckEvery* attribute specifies how out-of-date you
are willing to allow your changing datasets to be, not how often the
data changes. If you want updates to be seen within 5 min, use 5 minutes
here, regardless of the frequency of updating._

== Aggregation Caching

For large collection of files, one wants to avoid opening every single
file each time the dataset is accessed. Instead we only want to open the
files that are actually needed to fulfill a data request. Generally this
is straightforward, except for discovering the number and values of the
aggregation coordinate variable for type *joinExisting.* This is because
we have to know the size of the aggregation dimension when we open the
dataset, even before we read any data. For practical purposes, we often
need to know the coordinate values immediately also.

To help solve this problem, you should enable Aggregation Caching in
your application, by telling the ucar.nc2.ncml.Aggregation class where
it can cache information, by calling the static method (see javadoc for
more details):

----
// Enable Aggregation caching. Every hour, delete stuff older than 30 days
Aggregation.setPersistenceCache( new DiskCache2("/.unidata/aggCache", true, 60 * 24 * 30, 60));
----

When this is enabled, *joinExisting* aggregations will save information
to special XML files in the specified directory, in order to avoid
opening every file to obtain its coordinate values, each time the
dataset is opened. Instead, the first time it is opened, the values are
read, then subsequent opens will use the cached values.

If using a *scan* element on changing directories, be sure to specify
the *recheckEvery* attribute to make sure that the cached information
gets updated.

== Nested Aggregation

One can nest netcdf elements in aggregation, for example:
