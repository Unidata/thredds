= Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD)

_Ethan Davis_

_last updated 28 September 2005_

*This page has been superseded.* The current and development versions
can be found
http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Category:Attribute_Conventions_Dataset_Discovery[here].

== Overview

This document describes NetCDF attributes recommended for describing a
NetCDF dataset to discovery systems such as Digital Libraries. THREDDS
tools will use these attributes for extracting metadata from datasets,
and exporting to http://dublincore.org/[Dublin Core],
http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/User/difguide/difman.html[DIF],
http://www.dlese.org/Metadata/adn-item/[ADN],
http://www.fgdc.gov/[FGDC], http://www.isotc211.org/scope.htm#19115[ISO
19115] etc. metadata formats.

These attributes parallel THREDDS catalog specification’s
<<../../tds/catalog/InvCatalogServerSpec#,digital library
metadata>>. Attributes are used to add information inside the NetCDF
file, while THREDDS catalog metadata adds information external to the
NetCDF file.

Where appropriate, we use attributes described in the
link:/software/netcdf/docs/[NetCDF Users Guide] as well as some
attributes defined in the http://cfconventions.org/[CF convention]. Some
we use directly (e.g., "title" and "history") others we use unless
more detailed attributes defined here are given (e.g., "institution"
vs "creator_*"). +

== Attributes

=== acknowledgment Attribute

The "acknowledgment" attribute provides a place to acknowledge various
types of support for the project that produced the data. Use of this
attribute is recommended.

=== cdm_data_type Attribute

The "cdm_data_type" attribute gives the THREDDS data type appropriate
for this dataset. E.g., "Grid", "Image", "Station",
"Trajectory", "Radial". Its use is recommended.

=== comment Attribute

The "comment" attribute allows for miscellaneous information about the
dataset. Use of this attribute is recommended as appropriate. This
attribute originated in the
http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/[CF convention].

=== contributor_name and contributor_role Attribute

These attributes provide the name and role of any individuals or
institutions that contributed to the creation of the data. The use of
these attributes is suggested.

=== creator_email, creator_name, creator_url, and institution Attributes

These attributes provide the name, URL, and email contact information
for the creator of the data. The data creator may be an individual or an
institution. If the "creator_name" attribute does not exist, the
"institution" attribute will be used. If creator information other
than name is to be given, we recommend use of the "creator_*"
attributes.

Note: link:#note_email_address_persistence[email address persistence]

=== date_created Attribute

The "date_created" attribute gives the date on which the data was
created. Its use is recommended. +

=== date_issued Attribute

The "date_issued" attribute  provides the date on which this data was
formally issued. Use of this attribute is suggested when relevant to the
data and distinct from other dates used for this data.

=== date_modified Attribute

The "date_modified" attribute provides the date on which the data was
last modified. Use of this attribute is suggested if the data has been
modified since the date of creation.

=== geospatial_lat_max, geospatial_lat_min, geospatial_lat_resolution,
geospatial_lat_units, geospatial_lon_max, geospatial_lon_min,
geospatial_lon_resolution, geospatial_lon_units,
geospatial_vertical_max, geospatial_vertical_min,
geospatial_vertical_positive, geospatial_vertical_resolution, and
geospatial_vertical_units Attributes

Use the min and max attributes to describe a simple latitude, longitude,
vertical bounding box. If none of the other attributes are used,
latitude is assumed to be in decimal degrees north, longitude is assumed
to be in decimal degrees east, and vertical is assumed to be in meters
above ground. The use of these min/max geospatial attributes is
recommended.

Further refinement of the geospatial bounding box can be provided by
using the units and resolution attributes. The
geospatial_vertical_positive attribute indicates which direction is
positive (a value of "up" means that z increases up, like units of
height, while a value of "down" means that z increases downward, like
units of pressure or depth). The use of these further geospatial
attributes is suggested. +

=== history Attribute

The "history" attribute provides an audit trail for modifications to
the original data. It should contain a separate line for each
modification with each line including a timestamp, user name, 
modification name, and modification arguments. Its use is recommended
and its value will be used by THREDDS as a history-type documentation.
The "history" attribute is recommended by the
link:/packages/netcdf/docs/netcdf/[NetCDF Users Guide] and the
http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/[CF convention].

=== id and naming_authority Attributes

The "id" and "naming_authority" attributes are intended to provide a
globally unique identification for each dataset. The "id" value should
attempt to uniquely identify the dataset. The naming authority allows a
further refinement of the "id". The combination of the two should be
globally unique for all time. We recommend using reverse-DNS naming for
the naming authority. For example, naming_authority="edu.ucar.unidata"
and id="NCEP/NAM_211_2005-05-24_12Z".

=== keywords Attribute

The "keywords" attribute lists key words and phrases that are relevant
to the dataset. Its use is highly recommended. The values in the list
may be taken from a controlled list of keywords (e.g., the AGU Index
list or the GCMD Science Keywords). If a controlled list is used, the
link:#keywords_vocabulary_Attribute["keywords_vocabulary" attribute]
may be used to identify the list.

=== keywords_vocabulary Attribute

The "keywords_vocabulary" attribute identifies the controlled list of
keywords from which the values in the
link:#keywords_Attribute["keywords" attribute] are taken.  If you are
following a guideline for the words/phrases in your "keywords"
attribute, put the name of that guideline here. The use of this
attribute is recommended and its value will be used by THREDDS to
identify the vocabulary from which the keywords come. +

Common values for the "keywords_vocabulary" attribute include: +

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Vocabulary ID + |Reference URL +
|"AGU Index Terms" |http://www.agu.org/pubs/indexterms/

|"GCMD Science Keywords"
|http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Resources/valids/gcmd_parameters.html
|=======================================================================

  +

=== license Attribute

The "license" attribute describes the restrictions to data access and
distribution. Use of this attribute is recommended, especially if there
are constraints on the use of the data. +
 +
 Notes: link:#note_change_over_time[information may change over time].

=== long_name Attribute

The "long_name" variable attribute provides a long descriptive name
for the variable (not necessarily from a controlled vocabulary). Its use
is highly recommended. If a "standard_name" attribute is not given
(and a "standard_name_vocabulary" is given), the "long_name"
attribute value will be used by THREDDS as the variable’s name in the
variable mapping. The "long_name" attribute is recommended by the
"link:/software/netcdf/docs/[NetCDF Users Guide]", the
http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html[COARDS
convention], and the http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/[CF
convention].

=== processing_level Attribute

The "processing_level" attribute provides a textual description of the
processing (or quality control) level of the data. The use of this
attribute is recommended. +

=== project Attribute

The "project" attribute provides the name of the scientific project
for which the data was created. The use of this attribute is
recommended.

=== publisher_name, publisher_url, and publisher_email Attribute

These attributes provide the data publisher’s name, URL, and email. The
publisher may be an individual or an institution. The use of these
attributes is suggested. +
 +
 Notes: link:#note_multi_site_availability[multiple publishers];
link:#note_overridden[override information];
link:#note_email_address_persistence[email address persistence] +

=== standard_name Attribute

The "standard_name" variable attribute provides a name for the
variable from a standard list of names. I.e., the value is from a
controlled vocabulary of variable names. We recommend using the
link:http://cfconventions.org/[CF convention] and the
variable names from the
link:http://cfconventions.org/standard-names.html[CF standard name]
table. Use of this attribute is highly recommended and
its value will be used by THREDDS as the variable’s name in the variable
mapping. (For THREDDS use, this attribute takes precedence over the
"long_name" attribute.) This attribute is recommended by the
link:http://cfconventions.org/[CF convention]. +

Note: Just remember, for a file to be CF compliant, all the
standard_name values must be from the CF standard name table. +

=== standard_name_vocabulary Attribute

The "standard_name_vocabulary" attribute indicates which controlled
list of variable names has been used in the "standard_name" attribute.
Use of this attribute is recommended and their value will be used by
THREDDS in the variable mapping. If the file uses the CF convention (and
the Convention attribute indicates this), THREDDS will assume the
standard_name values are from the CF convention standard name table. +
 +
 Common values for the "standard_name_vocabulary" attribute include: +

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Vocabulary ID + |Reference URL +
|"CF-1.0" +
|http://cfconventions.org/standard-names.html +

|"GCMD Science Keywords"
|http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Resources/valids/gcmd_parameters.html
|=======================================================================

 

=== summary Attribute

The "summary" attribute gives a longer description of the dataset. Its
use is highly recommended. In many discovery systems, the title and the
summary will be displayed in the results list from a search. It should
therefore capture the essence of the dataset it describes. For instance,
we recommend this field include information on the type of data
contained in the dataset, how the data was created (e.g., instrument X;
or model X, run Y), the creator of the dataset, the project for which
the data was created, the geospatial coverage of the data, and the
temporal coverage of the data. This should just be a summary of this
information, more detail should be provided in the
link:#recommended_creator[recommended creator attributes], the
link:#recommended_geospatial[recommended geospatial attributes], and the
link:#recommended_temporal[recommended temporal attributes].

=== time_coverage_start, time_coverage_end, time_coverage_duration, and
time_coverage_resolution Attributes

These attributes are used to describe the temporal coverage of the data.
The temporal coverage of the data can be described with any of the
following pairs of values: start/end, start/duration, or end/duration.
The start and end values should be a date string like an ISO8601 date
(e.g., "1999-07-04T22:30"), a udunits date (e.g., "25 days since
1970-01-01"), or the string "present". The duration value should be
an ISO8601 duration string (e.g., "P10D"). The resolution provides an
idea of the density of the data inside the time range and should also be
an ISO8601 duration string. The use of these attributes is recommended +

=== title Attribute

The "title" attribute gives a brief description of the dataset. Its
use is highly recommended and its value will be used by THREDDS as the
name of the dataset. It therefore should be human readable and
reasonable to display in a list of such names. The "title" attribute
is recommended by the
"link:https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/user_guide.html[NetCDF
Users Guide]" and the link:http://cfconventions.org/[CF convention].

=== units Attribute

The "units" variable attribute gives the units of the data contained
by that variable. The value of the "units" attribute should be a valid
link:https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/[udunits] string. Its
use is highly recommended
and its value will be used by THREDDS as the variable’s units in the
variable mapping. The "units" attribute is recommended by the
"link:/software/netcdf/docs/[NetCDF Users Guide]", the
http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html[COARDS
convention], and the link:http://cfconventions.org/[CF convention].

== Notes

1.  Since some datasets are made available from many sites, users may
decide to not provide this information.
2.  Since this information may change over time, users may decide not to
provide this information. +
3.  Any information can be overridden at the THREDDS catalog level.
4.  Since data files are often archived, try using email address that
will work for the long-term. Perhaps use an institutional email address
like support@<institution> or data@<institution> +
