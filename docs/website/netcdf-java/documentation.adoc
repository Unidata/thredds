 +
 The NetCDF-Java Library is a Java interface to
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/index.html[NetCDF files], as
well as to many other types of scientific data formats. 

The library is freely available and the source code is released under
the (MIT-style) NetCDF C library
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/copyright.html[license].
Previous versions use the GNU
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html[Lesser General Public License]
(LGPL).

The preferred place to ask questions, discuss problems and features and
get support is in the NetCDF-Java email list, which you can subscribe to
from http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/support/index.html#subscribe[this
page]. Also you might want to

or browse] previous netCDF-Java support questions.

=== Overview

The NetCDF-Java library implements a link:CDM/index.html[Common Data
Model](CDM), a generalization of the NetCDF, OpenDAP and HDF5 data
models. The library is a prototype for the
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/netcdf-4/index.html[NetCDF-4
project], which provides a C language API for the ``data access layer''
of the CDM, on top of the
http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html[HDF5 file format]. The
NetCDF-Java library is a 100% Java framework for _reading_ netCDF and
other file formats into the CDM, as well as _writing_ to the netCDF-3
file format. link:reference/netcdf4Clibrary.html[Writing to the netCDF-4
file format] requires installing the netCDF C library. The NetCDF-Java
library also implements
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ncml/[NcML], which allows
you to add metadata to CDM datasets, as well as to create virtual
datasets through aggregation. The link:../tds/TDS.html[THREDDS Data
Server] (TDS) is built on top of the NetCDF-Java library.

CDM/TDS source is hosted on https://github.com/Unidata/thredds[GitHub].
To build the latest stable version from source or contribute code to the
THREDDS project, see link:tutorial/SourceCodeBuild.html[here]. Most
projects use *netcdfAll.jar* or *toolsUI.jar* (see below for links), or
include the desired http://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/[artifacts] in
their maven or gradle builds. See
link:reference/BuildDependencies.html[Build Dependencies] for details.

=== File format types

The NetCDF-Java library can read various
link:reference/formats/FileTypes.html[file types and remote access
protocols].

Notes to GRIB users:

* *You must use 4.6+ branch to read GRIB files. Many bug fixes and
improvements are on that branch. Other branches are not supported.*
* If your GRIB files are using non-WMO-standard tables, please closely
examine the output from the CDM and report problems. Obtain the tables
from the producer is possible and send them to us.
* Indexing has changed since 4.3 (this will be detected automatically).
* Evolving documentation for GRIB is at:

_________________________________________________________
* link:reference/formats/GribTables.html[GribTables.html]
* link:reference/formats/GribFiles.html[GribFiles.html]
_________________________________________________________

=== Caveats and not-so-stable APIs:

* *Writing* to netCDF-3 format is supported, but extended features in
the CDM, e.g. groups, structures, long data types are not yet supported.
* *Writing* to netCDF-4 format is supported, if you have the
link:reference/netcdf4Clibrary.html[netCDF C library loaded].
* The catalog API will be redone, however the current API will remain
supported if possible.
