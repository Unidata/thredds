= image:netcdfBig.gif[image] NetCDF-Java Library

The NetCDF-Java Library is a pure Java interface to
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/index.html[NetCDF files], as
well as to many other types of scientific data formats. 

The library is freely available and the source code is released under
the (MIT-style) NetCDF C library
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/copyright.html[license].
Previous versions use the GNU
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html[Lesser General Public License]
(LGPL).

The preferred place to ask questions, discuss problems and features and
get support is in the NetCDF-Java email list, which you can subscribe to
from http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/support/index.html#subscribe[this
page]. Also you might want to
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/mailing_lists/archives/netcdf-java/[search
or browse] previous netCDF-Java support questions.

== Overview

The NetCDF-Java library implements a <<CDM/index#,Common Data Model>>(CDM), a generalization of the NetCDF, OpenDAP and HDF5 data models.
The library is a prototype for the http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/netcdf-4/index.html[NetCDF-4 project],
which provides a C language API for the *_data access layer_* of the CDM, on top of the
http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html[HDF5 file format].
The NetCDF-Java library is a 100% Java framework for _reading_ netCDF and other file formats into the CDM, as well as _writing_ to the netCDF-3 file format.
<<reference/netcdf4Clibrary#,Writing to the netCDF-4 file format>> requires installing the netCDF C library.
The NetCDF-Java library also implements http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ncml/[NcML],
which allows you to add metadata to CDM datasets, as well as to create virtual datasets through aggregation.
The <<../tds/TDS#,THREDDS Data Server>> (TDS) is built on top of the NetCDF-Java library.

CDM/TDS source is hosted on https://github.com/Unidata/thredds[GitHub].
To build the latest stable version from source or contribute code to the
THREDDS project, see <<tutorial/SourceCodeBuild#,here>>. Most
projects use *netcdfAll.jar* or *toolsUI.jar* (see below for links), or
include the desired http://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/[artifacts] in
their maven or gradle builds. See
<<reference/BuildDependencies#,Build Dependencies>> for details.

=== Current stable release version 4.6 (requires Java 7)

* The ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf-java/v4.6/netcdfAll-4.6.jar[complete
netCDF library jar] implements the full CDM model, with all dependent
jars included.
* The ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf-java/v4.6/toolsUI-4.6.jar[toolsUI.jar]

application directly from it such as "__java -Xmx1g -jar toolsUI.jar__"
* The ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf-java/v4.6/ncIdv-4.6.jar[ncIDV.jar]
is for the development branch of the IDV.
* <<javadoc/index#,Public javadoc.>> This is the public interface.
Future changes to the API will attempt to remain backwards compatible
with this API.
* <<javadocAll/index#,All javadoc>>. This is the javadoc for all packages and all methods except private. CAREFUL, much of this will change.

[[v50]]
=== Current development version 5.0 (requires Java 8)

* The ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf-java/v5.0/netcdfAll-5.0.jar[complete netCDF library jar]
implements the full CDM model, with all dependent jars included.
* The ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf-java/v5.0/toolsUI-5.0.jar[toolsUI.jar]
also includes UI classes, and allows you to run the netCDF ToolsUI application directly from it such as "__java -Xmx1g -jar toolsUI.jar__"
* The ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf-java/v5.0/ncIdv-5.0.jar[ncIDV.jar] is for the development branch of the IDV.
* http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/v5.0/netcdf-java/javadoc/index.html[Public javadoc.]
This is the public interface. Future changes to the API will attempt to remain backwards compatible with this API.
* http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/v5.0/netcdf-java/javadocAll/index.html[All javadoc].
This is the javadoc for all packages and all methods except private. CAREFUL, much of this will change.
* Try out the *5.0* version of ToolsUI application:
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/v5.0/netcdf-java/webstart/netCDFtools.jnlp[launch from webstart].
* Unidata public https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/[Maven repository] for maven artifacts
* All source is on https://github.com/Unidata/thredds[GitHub]
* Version 5 is a magor version upgrade with <<{tdsDocs}/../UpgradingTo5#,many improvements to the API>>.

=== File format types

The NetCDF-Java library can read various <<reference/formats/FileTypes#,file types and remote access protocols>>.

Notes to GRIB users:

* *You must use 4.6+ branch to read GRIB files. Many bug fixes and improvements are on that branch. Other branches are not supported.*
* If your GRIB files are using non-WMO-standard tables, please closely
examine the output from the CDM and report problems. Obtain the tables
from the producer is possible and send them to us.
* Indexing has changed since 4.3 (this will be detected automatically).
* Evolving documentation for GRIB is at:

** <<reference/formats/GribTables#,GribTables.adoc>>
** <<reference/formats/GribFiles#,GribFiles.adoc>>

=== Caveats and not-so-stable APIs:

* *Writing* to netCDF-3 format is supported, but extended features in the CDM, e.g. groups, structures, long data types are not yet supported.
* *Writing* to netCDF-4 format is supported, if you have the <<reference/netcdf4Clibrary#,netCDF C library loaded>>.
