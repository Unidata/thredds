= Enabling TDS Remote Management

== Overview

It’s very convenient to be able to remotely manage and administer the
Tomcat web server, and to remotely configure and debug the Thredds Data
Server, for example from a web browser running on your desktop. However,
remote access to the server introduces potential security problems, so
by default these capabilities are not turned on. You can run Tomcat and
TDS quite successfully by editing the configuration files on the server,
and restarting when needed.

Managing a server is difficult and we recommend that you enable remote
management. By following the procedures here, you can do so without
opening any big security holes. However, you must decide this yourself,
based on your organization’s security policies, and a risk assessment
for your server. In what follows we try to explain what risks the
various options have, as well as we understand them. A good compromise
may be to do all the work to enable remote management, then turn it on
only while actively configuring the server, and turn it off when in
production mode.

In any case, we strongly recommend that you also read and follow the
<<TomcatSecurity#,Tomcat/TDS Security guidelines>>.

Follow the <<../tutorial/Checklist#,checklist>> for more concise
and up-to-date configuration instruction.

== Configuring Tomcat Users

Special permissions (like remote management) are done in Tomcat by
creating _*users*_ with special __*roles*__. As long as you also follow
the <<TomcatSecurity#,Tomcat/TDS Security guidelines>>, using the
simplest Tomcat mechanism to do this should be safe.

Edit **$\{tomcat_home}/conf/tomcat-users.xml**, adding roles
_tdsConfig_, _manager_, _admin_, and users who have those roles,
e.g.:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="manager"/>
  <role rolename="admin"/>
  <role rolename="tdsConfig"/>

  <user username="admin" password="adminpassword" roles="admin, manager-gui, manager"/>
  <user username="yername" password="yerpassword" roles="tdsConfig"/>
</tomcat-users>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The __*manager*__, __*manager-gui*__, and _*admin*_ roles are used
within Tomcat itself to allow the use of the manager and administrator
web interface. The _*tdsConfig*_ role is used to configure the TDS.
These roles must be specified exactly as shown. Note that all 3 of these
roles are independent - you can add any, all or none of them. The
easiest way to enable or disable remote administration is to change this
file and restart Tomcat.

The list of users, their names and passwords, are whatever you want them
to be. Note that after you get this set up, you can manage users
remotely through the administrator interface. Note also that before you
go into production mode, you should change to using digest passwords by
following the instructions <<TomcatSecurity.adoc#Digest,here>>.

Note that any changes won’t take effect until you restart Tomcat.

*Higher Security:* You can also use an LDAP server or a Database to
store users and roles, which may give you higher levels of security. Use
of this feature is beyond the scope of this documentation, however.

== Enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

We ensure that no one can intercept and read sensitive information to
and from the server (through doing what’s called __network sniffing__)
by encrypting the information using SSL. To enable this, do the
following:

1.  Choose a keystore filename **$\{keystore_filename}.** If this option
is not specified, it defaults to **$\{user_home}/.keystore**.
2.  Create a certificate by executing the following command:
+
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
${java_home}/bin/keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -validity 365 -keystore ${keystore_filename}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
You will then get a set of prompts:
+
-----------------------------------
Enter keystore password: mypassword
-----------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------
What is your first and last name? [Unknown]: www.mydomain.edu
-------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------
What is the name of your organizational unit? [Unknown]:
---------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
What is the name of your organization? [Unknown]:
--------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------
What is the name of your City or Locality? [Unknown]:
------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------
What is the name of your State or Province? [Unknown]:
-------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------
What is the two-letter country code for this unit? [Unknown]:
--------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is CN=*.ucar.edu, OU=UCAR Web Engineering Group, O=University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, L=Boulder, ST=Colorado, C=US correct?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------
[no]: yes
---------

-------------------------------
Enter key password for <tomcat>
-------------------------------

--------------------------------------
(RETURN if same as keystore password):
--------------------------------------

Its not obvious, but the _first and last name_ must be the name of
your Tomcat server host machine (**www.mydomain.edu** in this example).
Be sure to specify the same password for both the keystore and the
<tomcat> key password (the default is **changeit**). Fill out the other
values as appropriate. This creates a _self-signed certificate_ and puts
it into the **$\{keystore_filename}** keystore. Note the *validity*
option on the command line, which is the number of days the certificate
is valid.
3.  In **$\{tomcat_home}/conf/server.xml**, find the following section
that configures the SSL port (**not** the regular 8080 port), uncomment
it, and modify it so it looks like:
+
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <!-- Define a SSL Coyote HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8443 -->
    <Connector port="8443"  protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.http11NioProtocol"
               SSLEnabled="true"
               maxThreads="150" minSpareThreads="25"
               enableLookups="false" disableUploadTimeout="true"
               acceptCount="100" scheme="https" secure="true"
               clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" keystoreFile="${keystore_filename}"
      keystorePass="mypassword"/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This enables Tomcat to use port 8443 for the HTTPS protocol, which uses
SSL. All sensitive accesses will get redirected to that port.

See
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/index.html#security[keytool
documentation] for full description of managing keystores. The
http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-7.0-doc/ssl-howto.html[Tomcat
doc] is quite good, also.

=== Installing a Certificate from a Certificate Authority

The use of SSL in this way prevents a network sniffer from getting your
password. A more sophisticated (and more difficult to perform) attack is
the so called _man-in-the-middle_ attack where someone pretends to be
your server, and induces your client to send the password to it.

In the above, we used self-signed certificates, and your browser will
give you a warning each time you access a web page that uses self-signed
certificates. It will allow you to choose to continue however, and so a
clever enough attacker might induce you to accept their self-signed
certificate. To prevent this, you can obtain a certificate signed by a
_Certificate Authority_ (CA). You can then install it using
http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-7.0-doc/ssl-howto.html#Installing%20a%20Certificate%20from%20a%20Certificate%20Authority[these
instructions]. The browser will see that its a valid certificate, and so
you will never accept self-signed certificates and you will preclude
man-in-the-middle attacks.

Obtaining and installing a CA signed certificate is a fair amount of
work, but not really all that difficult. We recommend it if you plan on
leaving remote management enabled in production mode.

=== Using the JRE keystore

Third party authentication software such as CAS may require that a
remote host’s certificate be placed into the JRE keystore.

1.  Obtain the remote host’s certificate and place into a temporary
file, say **server.crt**. For example, if running a CAS server in
Tomcat, you want to use the tomcat certificate that we generated above.
To extract it, use:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 keytool -export -alias tomcat -keypass changeit -keystore ${keystore_filename} -file server.crt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Import the certificate into the JRE’s keystore. Be sure to use the
same JRE that Tomcat will run under:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  keytool -import -alias tomcat -keypass changeit -file server.crt -keystore ${jre_home}/lib/security/cacerts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If there are spaces, you need to quote the filename, eg:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -keystore "C:/Program Files (x86)/Java/jdk1.7.0_04/jre/lib/security/cacerts"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the certificate is not correctly installed (eg you put it in the
wrong JRE), you will get an Exception like:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Check that the correct ports are enabled

After restarting Tomcat, you can use *netstat -an* command to check that
the ports are correctly configured. You should see lines like:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
  TCP    127.0.0.1:8080         0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
  TCP    127.0.0.1:8443         0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You also need to make sure that your firewall is allowing those ports
through.

== TDS Remote Debugging

Once SSL is enabled, you can remotely debug and configure the TDS. You
need to login with a user who has the *tdsConfig* role.

Debugging information is available at
*http://localhost:8080/thredds/admin/debug.*

image:images/TdsDebug.png[image]

Some capabilities of particular interest are:

1.  **Show Tomcat Logs**: allows you to look at the Tomcat logs in
*$\{tomcat_home}/logs*
2.  *Show TDS Logs:* allows you to look at the TDS logs in
*$\{tomcat_home}/content/thredds/logs*
3.  *Show static catalogs:* list all the static (non-dynamic) catalogs
read in at startup
4.  *Show data roots:* list all the dataRoots with links to the
directories they are mapped to
5.  **Show File Object Caches**: Show all files currently in the object
caches
6.  *Clear File Object Caches:* Remove all unlocked files in the object
caches

== TroubleShooting

* **Connection refused when trying to access a restricted page**. The
SSL socket is not enabled in the server.xml file, or you didn’t install
a certificate in the keystore.
* *sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to
find valid certification path to requested target* : A 3rd party
security system like CAS is trying to establish an SSL connection.
link:#JRE_keystore[Install] the remote host’s certificate into the JRE
certificate store.
* *What’s in the keystore?*
** Look at the
https://localhost:8443/thredds/admin/debug?General/showServerInfo[Tomcat
Server Status] page and check the JVM Version.
** From command line, make sure that this matches the results of *`java
-version'.* If not, then your Tomcat server is starting up with a
different JVM.
** From command line, *`keytool -list'* will show you what’s in the
default keystore. Standard is to have password __changeit__. You need an
entry named __tomcat__.
