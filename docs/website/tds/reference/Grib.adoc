= GRIB

== Standards

=== GRIB1 and GRIB2

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Commission for Basic Systems (CBS) met in 1985 to create the GRIB (GRIdded Binary) format.
GRIB Edition 1 was approved in February 1994. GRIB Edition 2 format was approved in 2003. Transition to GRIB-2 has been slow, despite the severe limitations of GRIB-1.
By international treaty, national weather services are required to publish their data in GRIB (and BUFR) for international exchange.

Data is stored in compressed binary format, replacing earlier text encoding formats.

=== Standard Tables / Local Tables

Information in the files references external tables, either WMO standard tables or local tables defined by each National Center.
For criticism of GRIB table handling practices, see: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/staff/caron/papers/GRIBarchivals.pdf[Archiving in GRIB considered Harmful].

- WMO Standard Tables: http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/WMOCodes/WMO306_vI2/LatestVERSION/LatestVERSION.html
- WMO now publishes their standard tables in XML for GRIB2 (though not GRIB1): http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/WMOCodes/WMO306_vI2/LatestVERSION/GRIB2_16_0_0.zip

==== NCEP

NCEP does not publish their tables in a machine-readable format, so we periodically screenscrape their HTML pages. The results are stored in the THREDDS GIT site.

== Raw GRIB

=== Streaming

GRIB is a record-oriented format, each record is nominally independent of any other. GRIB files typically consist of concateneated GRIB records.
To read the individual records in a GRIB-1 file, one can use the following:

[source,java]
----
      RandomAccessFile dataRaf = new RandomAccessFile(location, "r");
      Grib1RecordScanner scan = new Grib1RecordScanner(dataRaf);
      while (scan.hasNext()) {
        Grib1Record r = scan.next();
        if (r == null) break; // done
        // do stuff
        Grib1SectionGridDefinition gdss = r.getGDSsection();
        ...
      }
----

Grib2RecordScanner and GRIB2record are similarly used for GRIB-2 records. See those classes for more details. Note that these are not considered public APIs.
