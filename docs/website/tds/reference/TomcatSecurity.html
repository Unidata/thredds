<h1>Tomcat Security</h1>

<hr>
<p>We believe Tomcat to be secure enough for typical scientific uses. There are no known security exploits or weaknesses. However, the Internet is a wild place,
  and we are not security experts so <em>caveat emptor</em>. These are best practices for running Tomcat. </p>
<p>Alos see:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../tutorial/AdditionalSecurityConfiguration.html">Tomcat Security in TDS Tutorial</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596101060/">https://www.mulesoft.com/tcat/tomcat-security</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Run as Unprivileged User </h2>

<p>By default, Tomcat runs on port 8080 and therefore does not require root to run. Its important not to run as root. Create a special user, e.g. named &quot;tomcat&quot;,
  which owns everything under <strong>${tomcat_home}</strong>, and change to that user to run Tomcat. This special user will need read/write access to <strong>${tomcat_home}</strong>
  and its subdirectories, and read access to your data directories. <em>Don't give the tomcat user any rights in any other directories</em>. If your operating
  system allows it (e.g. Unix, Linux), you might also not allow the tomcat user to log in, requiring instead that you log in as yourself, then switch to being
  the tomcat user. </p>

<h2> Restrict access to critical files</h2>

<p>Make sure that everything under <strong>${tomcat_home}/conf/</strong> can be read only by the tomcat user. Typically you would also give write access to the
  tomcat user. </p>

<h2>Use a Firewall</h2>

<p>Unless you are on a private network, you need a firewall. A firewall restricts who is allowed to access network ports. Make the default setting to disallow
  all accesses, then enable just the ones that are needed. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Port <strong>8080</strong> should have unrestricted access.</li>
  <li>If you are allowing <a href="RemoteManagement.html">remote management</a>, you must also open up port <strong>8443</strong>.</li>
  <li>Tomcat also uses port <strong>8005</strong> to enable shutdown. However, shutdown can only be run from the same machine as Tomcat is running from. As long
    as untrusted users aren't running on your server machine, you shouldn't have to worry about this port being open. However, you might want to restrict public
    access to it so hackers aren't tempted.
  </li>
  <li>If you are also using Tomcat in conjunction with another web server like Apache to handle servlet/JSP requests, you need to allow that server access to
    port <strong>8009</strong>, but typically that can be restricted to accesses on the same machine or at least on your subnet. If you are running Tomcat only
    standalone (e.g. only running the THREDDS data server) then disable port 8009 in <strong>${tomcat_home}/conf/server.xml file.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Remove Default Tomcat Applications</strong></h2>

<p>Tomcat ships with several default web applications, found in the <strong>${tomcat_home}/webapps</strong> directory. These defaults depend on the version of
  Tomcat and which installer you use. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>ROOT</strong> application contains the server's main page. Any file that you add under <strong>${tomcat_home}/webapps/ROOT</strong> will be
    served.
  </li>
  <li> The <strong>admin</strong> and <strong>manager</strong> applications are used for remote management. To use these applications, you must add users with
    roles <strong>admin</strong> and <strong>manager</strong>, respectively. The applications are then accessible from the main page, and can be used to add
    further users, start and stop webapps, etc. You should restrict the IP addresses that are allowed to run these applications by editing the files <strong>admin.xml</strong>
    and <strong>manager.xml</strong> in the <strong>${tomcat_home}/conf/Catalina/localhost/ </strong>directory.
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>servlets-examples</strong> and <strong>jsp-examples</strong> should probably be removed from a production server, to minimize security
    exposure. You can do this from the manager application or by deleting those directories from <strong>${tomcat_home}/webapps</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>tomcat-docs, balancer </strong> and <strong>webdav</strong> applications are probably harmless, but can also be removed if you want.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Store Passwords as Digest<a name="Digest"></a></h2>

<p>The file <strong>${tomcat_home}/conf/tomcat-users.xml </strong> stores user names and passwords. By default the passwords are in clear text, e.g.: </p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?&gt;<br>&lt;tomcat-users&gt;<br>  &lt;role rolename=&quot;tdsConfig&quot;/&gt;<br>  &lt;role rolename=&quot;manager&quot;/&gt;<br>  &lt;role rolename=&quot;admin&quot;/&gt;<br>  &lt;user username=&quot;sysadmin&quot; password=&quot;yrPassword&quot; roles=&quot;manager,admin&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;user username=&quot;cataloger&quot; password=&quot;myPassword&quot; roles=&quot;tdsConfig&quot;/&gt;<br>&lt;/tomcat-users&gt;</pre>
<p>Store them instead in digested form. First generate the digest (do this for each user): </p>
<pre>  &gt; cd  <strong>${tomcat_home}/</strong>bin
  &gt; ./digest.sh -a SHA yrPassword
  &gt; yrPassword:aa01ea2afaae56c2b7da5e25ec18c505e58f12d7</pre>
<p>If you are using DIGEST authentication, (only needed if you arent using SSL), then use <strong><code>{username}:{realm}:{yrPassword}</code></strong> instead
  of <strong><code>{yrPassword}</code></strong> in calculating the digest, for example <strong><code>sysadmin:THREDDS Data Server:yrPassword</code></strong>.
  See <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/realm-howto.html#Digested%20Passwords">this</a> for more details. </p>

<p>Then cut and paste the digested passwords into the <strong>tomcat-users.xml</strong>:</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?&gt;<br>&lt;tomcat-users&gt;<br>  &lt;role rolename=&quot;tdsConfig&quot;/&gt;<br>  &lt;role rolename=&quot;manager&quot;/&gt;<br>  &lt;role rolename=&quot;admin&quot;/&gt;<br>  &lt;user username=&quot;sysadmin&quot; password=&quot;aa01ea2afaae56c2b7da5e25ec18c505e58f12d7&quot; roles=&quot;manager,admin&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;user username=&quot;cataloger&quot; password=&quot;5413ee24723bba2c5a6ba2d0196c78b3ee4628d1&quot; roles=&quot;tdsConfig&quot;/&gt;<br>&lt;/tomcat-users&gt;
</pre>
<p>Then change the <strong>server.xml</strong> file to tell it to use digested passwords, by adding this &lt;Realm&gt; element to the &lt;Host&gt; element named
  <strong>localhost</strong>:</p>
<pre>&lt;Host name=&quot;localhost&quot; debug=&quot;0&quot; appBase=&quot;/opt/tomcat/webapps&quot; unpackWARs=&quot;true&quot; autoDeploy=&quot;true&quot; 
     xmlValidation=&quot;false&quot; xmlNamespaceAware=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
  <strong>&lt;Realm className=&quot;org.apache.catalina.realm.MemoryRealm&quot; digest=&quot;SHA&quot; /&gt;</strong>
  ...
&lt;/Host&gt;
</pre>
<h2>Separate<a id="Separate"></a> User Roles For Restricted Datasets</h2>

<p>The <em>tdsConfig, manager </em>and<em> admin</em> roles allow access to secure parts of Tomcat and TDS. These can only be accessed using HTTPS (TLS), and so
  are considered secure. If you are <a href="RestrictedAccess.html">restricting access to datasets</a>, you will also add other users who will have the <strong>restrictedDatasetUser </strong>role<strong>.
    <em>Do not give any of these users (including yourself!) any of the </em>tdsConfig, manager <em>or</em> admin<em> roles - keep them strictly separate.</em>
  </strong>This is because <strong>restrictedDatasetUser </strong>usage can also use non-HTTPS URLs, and so is vulnerable to
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking">session hijacking</a>. By keeping the roles separate, you make sure that the worst that can happen is
  that someone can download some scientific data they shouldn't have access to.<br>
</p>

<h2>Restrict Access to Tomcat Manager Applications </h2>

<p>The best way to secure the Tomcat manager and administration webapps is to restrict the set of
  IP addresses that can access them. This can be accomplished by including a RemoteAddrValve
  (<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/valve.html#Remote_Address_Filter">Tomcat docs</a>)
  in the Context element of these applications. For instance, to only allows connections from the localhost
  (127.0.0.1), i.e., the machine on which the Tomcat server is running, do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Edit <strong>${tomcat_home}/conf/Catalina/localhost/admin.xml</strong>. It will probably look something like this:
    <pre>
&lt;Context antiResourceLocking=&quot;false&quot; privileged=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
    </pre>
    Change it to include the highlighted line here:
    <pre>
&lt;Context antiResourceLocking=&quot;false&quot; privileged=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
    <strong>&lt;Valve className=&quot;org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve&quot; allow=&quot;127\.0\.0\.1&quot;/&gt;</strong>
&lt;/Context&gt;
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Edit <strong>${tomcat_home}/conf/Catalina/localhost/manager.xml</strong> and add the same line:
    <pre>
&lt;Context antiResourceLocking=&quot;false&quot; privileged=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
    <strong>&lt;Valve className=&quot;org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve&quot; allow=&quot;127\.0\.0\.1&quot;/&gt;</strong>
&lt;/Context&gt;
    </pre>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: The value of the <strong>allow</strong> attribute must be a comma separated list of regular expressions
  used to match against the remote client's IP address. Here are several examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>allow="128\.117\.140\.62"</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>allow="128\.117\.140\.62,128\.117\.140\.63,128\.117\.140\.99"</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>allow="128\.117\.140\..*"</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, you can use the <em><strong>RemoteHostValve</strong></em> to filter by host name. Again, the value
  of the <strong>allow</strong> and <strong>deny</strong> attributes must be a comma separated list of regular
  expressions which will be used to match against the remote client's host name. For instance: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><strong>&lt;Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteHostValve" allow=".*\.ucar\.edu"/&gt;</strong></pre>
</blockquote>

<h2> Java Security Manager</h2>

<p>An additional level of security can be provided by running Tomcat with the Java Security Manager turned on. This can provide fine-grained security policies,
  at the cost of complexity in understanding what rights are needed to do any useful work, and how to grant them. This is needed if you allow untrusted servlets
  or JSPs to execute on your machine. If you are running just the THREDDS Data Server, you probably don't need to deal with this. </p>
