== Digital Library Record Generation with the DLwriter Service

=== Configuration

The DLwriter service must be enabled in the threddsConfig.xml
configuration file before it can be used. This is done by adding the
following lines:

---------------------
<CatalogServices>
  <allow>true</allow>
</CatalogServices>
---------------------

Further configuration must be done before the DLwriter can be used on
remote catalogs. This requires the addition of an allowRemote element:

---------------------------------
<CatalogServices>
  <allow>true</allow>
  <allowRemote>true</allowRemote>
</CatalogServices>
---------------------------------

=== Usage

The DLwriter service generates digital library records for each dataset
in a given catalog. The following parameters can be used:

* ``catalog'' - the URL of the target catalog (relative to the request
URL or absolute [if enabled with allowRemote as above])
* ``type'' - the value must be either ``DIF'' or ``ADN''

As follows: +

* http://servername:port/thredds/DLwriter?type=(ADN|DIF)&[catalog=__catalog.xml__]
* Default catalog is /thredds/idd/models.xml

The digital library records are written to
`${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/DLwriter`.
