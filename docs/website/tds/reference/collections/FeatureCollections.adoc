= Feature Collection configuration

== Overview

The *featureCollection* element is a way to tell the TDS to serve collections of <<../../../netcdf-java/reference/FeatureDatasets/Overview#,CDM
Feature Dataset>>. Currently this is used for gridded and point datasets whose time and spatial coordinates are recognized by the CDM software stack.
This allows the TDS to automatically create logical datasets composed of collections of files, and to allow subsetting in coordinate space on them,
through the WMS, WCS, Netcdf Subsetting and CDM Remote Feature services.

Feature Collections have been undergoing continual development and refinement in the recent version of the TDS, and as you upgrade there are (mostly)
minor changes to configuration and usage. The *featureCollection* element was first introduced TDS 4.2, replacing the *fmrcDataset* element in earlier
versions. TDS 4.2 allowed featureType = _FMRC, Point,_ and __Station__. TDS 4.3 added featureType = __GRIB__, used for collections of GRIB files. TDS
4.5 changed this usage to featureType = _GRIB1 or GRIB2_. TDS 5.0 added refinements for performance.

*Only serve GRIB files with featureCollection=GRIB1 or GRIB2. Do not use FMRC, or NcML Aggregations on GRIB files.*

A fair amount of the complexity of feature collections is managing the collection of files on the server, both in creating indexes for performance,
and in managing collections that change. For high-performance servers, it is necessary to let a background process manage indexing, and the THREDDS
Data Manager (<<TDM#,TDM>>) is now available for that purpose.

This document gives an overview of Feature Collections, as well as a complete syntax of allowed elements.

== Example catalog elements

The *featureCollection* element is a subtype of *dataset* element. It defines a _logical dataset_ for the TDS. All of the elements that can be used
inside of a *dataset* element can be used inside of a *featureCollection* element.

=== Example 1: Simple case using defaults

[source,xml]
----
 <featureCollection name="NCEP Polar Sterographic" featureType="GRIB2" path="grib/NCEP/NAM/Polar_90km"> # <1>
   <collection name="NCEP-NAM-Polar_90km" spec="/data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/NAM/Polar_90km/NAM_Polar_90km_.*\.grib2$"/> # <2>
 </featureCollection>
----

<1>  A GRIB2 Feature Collection dataset is defined, with the "human readable" name of "NCEP Polar Sterographic". Its URL path(s) will look like
_\http://server/thredds/<service>/grib/NCEP/NAM/Polar_90km/..._ The Dataset ID is automatically set to the path, so that its dataset page will be
__\http://server/thredds/catalog/grib/NCEP/NAM/Polar_90km/catalog.xml?dataset=grib/NCEP/NAM/Polar_90km__/...
<2>  Defines the files in the collection as any files in the directory _/data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/NAM/Polar_90km/_ which match the regular
expression _NAM_Polar_90km.*\.grib2$_. In this case, it means any filename starting with _NAM_Polar_90km_ and ending with _.grib2_.
The collection name is _NCEP-NAM-Polar_90km_, which is used for index file names etc.

=== Example 2: Specify the options explicitly

[source,xml]
----
<featureCollection name="NCEP NAM Alaska(11km)" featureType="GRIB2" path="grib/NCEP/NAM/Alaska_11km">
 <metadata inherited="true">
   <serviceName>GribServices</serviceName> # <1>
   <documentation type="summary">NCEP GFS Model : AWIPS 230 grid</documentation> # <2>
 </metadata>
 <collection spec="/data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/NAM/Alaska_11km/.*grib2$" # <3>
             name="NAM_Alaska_11km"
             dateFormatMark="#NAM_Alaska_11km_#yyyyMMdd_HHmm" # <4>
             timePartition="file" # <5>
             olderThan="5 min"/> # <6>
 <update startup="nocheck"/> # <7>
 <tdm rewrite="test" rescan="0 0/15 * * * ? *" /> # <8>
</featureCollection>
----

<1>  Arbitrary metadata can be added to the catalog. Here, we indicate to use the service called "GribServices" (not shown, but likely a compound
service that includes all the services you want to provide for GRIB Feature Collections).
<2>  A documention element of type "__summary__" is added to the catalog for this dataset.
<3>  The collection consists of all files ending with "__grib2__" in the directory "__/data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/NAM/Alaska_11km/__".
<4>  A date will be extracted from the filename, and the files will then be sorted by date. Important if the lexigraphic ordering is different that the
date order.
<5>  Partitioning will happen at the file level.
<6>  Only include files whose lastModified date is more than 5 minutes old. This is to exclude files that are actively being created.
<7>  Instruct the TDS to use the collection index if it already exists, without testing if its up-to-date.
<8>  Instruct the TDM to examine all the files to detect if they have changed since the index was written. Rescan every 15 minutes.

== Description of elements in TDS Configuration catalogs [[elements]]

=== *featureCollection* element

A *featureCollection* is a kind of *dataset* element, and so can contain the same elements and attributes of that element. Following is the XML Schema
definition for the _featureCollection_ element:

[source,xml]
----
  <xsd:element name="featureCollection" substitutionGroup="dataset">
    <xsd:complexType>
      <xsd:complexContent>
        <xsd:extension base="DatasetType">
          <xsd:sequence>
            <xsd:element type="collectionType" name="collection"/>
            <xsd:element type="updateType" name="update" minOccurs="0"/>
            <xsd:element type="tdmType" name="tdm" minOccurs="0"/>
            <xsd:element type="protoDatasetType" name="protoDataset" minOccurs="0"/>
            <xsd:element type="fmrcConfigType" name="fmrcConfig" minOccurs="0"/>
            <xsd:element type="pointConfigType" name="pointConfig" minOccurs="0"/>
            <xsd:element type="gribConfigType" name="gribConfig" minOccurs="0"/>
            <xsd:element type="fileSortType" name="filesSort" minOccurs="0" />
            <xsd:element ref="ncml:netcdf" minOccurs="0"/>
          </xsd:sequence>
          <xsd:attribute name="featureType" type="featureTypeChoice" use="required"/>
          <xsd:attribute name="path" type="xsd:string" use="required"/>
        </xsd:extension>
      </xsd:complexContent>
    </xsd:complexType>
  </xsd:element>

  <xsd:simpleType name="featureTypeChoice">
    <xsd:union memberTypes="xsd:token">
      <xsd:simpleType>
        <xsd:restriction base="xsd:token">
          <xsd:enumeration value="FMRC"/>
          <xsd:enumeration value="GRIB1"/>
          <xsd:enumeration value="GRIB2"/>
          <xsd:enumeration value="Point"/>
          <xsd:enumeration value="Station"/>
        </xsd:restriction>
      </xsd:simpleType>
    </xsd:union>
  </xsd:simpleType>
----

Here is an example *featureCollection* as you might put it into a TDS catalog:

[source,xml]
----
<featureCollection name="Metar Station Data" harvest="true" featureType="Station" path="nws/metar/ncdecoded"> # <1>
  <metadata inherited="true"> # <2>
     <serviceName>fullServices</serviceName>
     <documentation type="summary">Metars: hourly surface weather observations</documentation>
     <documentation xlink:href="http://metar.noaa.gov/" xlink:title="NWS/NOAA information"/>
     <keyword>metar</keyword>
     <keyword>surface observations</keyword>
   </metadata>
  <collection name="metars" spec="/data/ldm/pub/decoded/netcdf/surface/metar/Surface_METAR_#yyyyMMdd_HHmm#.nc$" /> # <3>
  <update startup="test" rescan="0 0/15 * * * ? *"/> # <4>
  <protoDataset choice="Penultimate" /> # <5>
  <pointConfig datasetTypes="cdmrFeature Files"/> # <6>
  <netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2"> # <7>
     <attribute name="Conventions" value="CF-1.6"/>
  </netcdf>
</featureCollection>
----

<1>  A *featureCollection* is declared, using the _name_ and _harvest_ attributes declared by the dataset element. The *_featureType_* is a mandatory
attribute defining the type of the feature collection. The *_path_* is also required, which defines what the URL of this collection will be. It must
be unique over the entire TDS. If an _ID_ attribute is not specified on the featureCollection, the path attribute is used as the ID (this is a
recommended idiom).
<2>  As is usual with dataset elements, a block of metadata can be declared that will be inherited by all the datasets.
<3>  The collection of files is defined. Each dataset is assigned a nominal time by extracting a date from the filename.
<4>  Specify that the collection is updated, when the TDS starts and in a background thread, every 15 minutes.
<5>  The prototype dataset is the next-to-last in the collection when sorted by time.
<6>  Configuration specific to the Point feature type: expose a _cdmrRemote_ service on the entire collection, and also serve all the component files
using the default service, in this example the compound service __fullServices__.
<7>  This NcML wraps each dataset in the collection. This attribute overrides any existing one in the datasets; it tells the CDM to parse the station
information using the CF Conventions.

=== *collection* element

A *collection* element defines the collection of datasets. Example:

[source,xml]
----
 <collection spec="/data/ldm/pub/native/satellite/3.9/WEST-CONUS_4km/WEST-CONUS_4km_3.9_.*gini$"
            dateFormatMark="#WEST-CONUS_4km_3.9_#yyyyMMdd_HHmm"
            name="WEST-CONUS_4km" olderThan="15 min" />
----

The XML Schema for the _collection_ element:

[source,xml]
----
 <xsd:complexType name="collectionType">
   <xsd:attribute name="spec" type="xsd:string" use="required"/> # <1>
   <xsd:attribute name="name" type="xsd:token"/> # <2>
   <xsd:attribute name="olderThan" type="xsd:string" /> # <3>
   <xsd:attribute name="dateFormatMark" type="xsd:string"/> # <4>
   <xsd:attribute name="timePartition" type="xsd:string"/> # <5>
 </xsd:complexType>
----

where

<1>  *spec* (required): <<CollectionSpecification#,collection specification>> string. In this example, the collection contains all files in the
directory _/data/ldm/pub/native/satellite/3.9/WEST-CONUS_4km/_ whose filename matches the regular expression _"WEST-CONUS_4km_3.9_.*gini$"_ (where
_".*"_ means "match any number of characters" and _"gini$"_ means "ends with the characters **gini"**. If you wanted to match **".gini"**, you would
need to escape the ".", ie __"\.gini$"__).
<2>  *name* (required): the collection name, which __*must be unique for all collections served by your TDS*__. This is used for external triggers, for
the CDM collection index files, and for logging and debugging messages. If missing, the _name_ attribute on the _<featureCollection>_ element is used.
However, we recommend that you create a unique, immutable name for the dataset collection, and put it in this *name* attribute of the *collection*
element.
<3>  *olderThan* (optional): Only files whose lastModified date is older than this are included. This is used to exclude files that are in the process
of being written. However, it only applies to newly found files; that is, once a file is in the collection it is not removed because it was updated.
<4>  *dateFormatMark* (optional): This defines a __link:#dateExtractor[DateExtractor]__, which is applied to each file in the collection to assign it a
date, which is used for sorting, getting the latest file, and possibly for time partitioning. In this example, the string *WEST-CONUS_4km_3.9_* is
located in each file path, then the <<SimpleDateFormat#,SimpleDateFormat>> template *yyyyMMdd_HHmm* is applied to the next characters of the
filename to create a date. A DateExtractor can also be defined in the <<CollectionSpecification#,collection specification>> string, but in that
case the date must be contained just in the file name, as opposed to the complete file path which includes all of the parent directory names. _Use
this OR a date extractor in the specification string, but not both._
<5>  *timePartition* (optional): Currently only used by GRIB collections, see <<Partitions#,here>> for more info.

=== *protoDataset* element

Provides control over the choice of the *_prototype dataset_* for the collection. The prototype dataset is used to populate the metadata for the
feature collection. Note that this is not used by GRIB feature collections. Example:

[source,xml]
----
 <protoDataset choice="Penultimate" change="0 2 3 * * ? *">
   <netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
     <attribute name="featureType" value="timeSeries"/>
   </netcdf>
 </protoDataset>
----

The XML Schema definition for the _protoDataset_ element:

[source,xml]
----
<xsd:complexType name="protoDatasetType">
  <xsd:sequence>
    <xsd:element ref="ncml:netcdf" minOccurs="0"/>  # <1>
  </xsd:sequence>
  <xsd:attribute name="choice" type="protoChoices"/> # <2>
  <xsd:attribute name="change" type="xsd:string"/> # <3>
</xsd:complexType>
----

<1>  *ncml:netcdf* = (optional) ncml elements that modify the prototype dataset
<2>  **choice**= [First | Random | Penultimate | Latest] : select prototype from a time ordered list, using the first, a randomly selected one, the
next to last, or the last dataset in the list. The default is "Penultimate".
<3>  **change**= "cron expr" (optional). On rolling datsets, you need to change the prototype periodically, otherwise it will get deleted eventually.
This attribute specifies when the protoDataset should be reselected, using a http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/docs/tutorials/crontrigger.html[cron
expression].
* _change = "0 2 3 * * ? *"_ means every day at 3.02 am.
* if not specified, the prototype dataset is not changed, except when restarting the TDS

The choice of the protoDataset matters when the datasets are not __homogenous__:

1.  Global and variable attributes are taken from the prototype dataset.
2.  If a variable appears in the prototype dataset, it will appear in the feature collection dataset. If it doesnt appear in other datasets, it will
have missing data for those times.
3.  If a variable does not appears in the prototype dataset, it will not appear in the feature collection dataset, even if it appears in other
datasets.

=== *update* element

For collections that change, the *update* element provides options to update the collection, either synchronously (while a user request waits) or
asynchronously (in a background task, so that requests do not wait).

For GRIB collections, dynamic updating of the collection by the TDS is no longer supported (use the TDM for this).
Therefore _recheckAfter_ and _rescan_ are ignored on an _update_ element for a GRIB collection.

Examples:

 <update startup="test" rescan="0 0/30 * * * ? *" trigger="false"/>

 <update recheckAfter="15 min" />

 <update startup="never" trigger="allow" />

.  The first example says to test if the dataset has been updated when the TDS starts up, then test in a background process every 30 minutes. (Cannot
use for GRIB collections, see *tdm* element below). Do not allow external triggers.
.  The second example says to test if the dataset has been updated only when a request comes in for it, and the dataset hasn't been checked for 15
minutes.
.  The third example tells the TDS to never update the collection indices, but to allow an external program (such as the TDM) to send a trigger
telling the TDS that it should reread the collection into memory. This is useful for large collections of data where even testing if a dataset has
changed can be costly.

The XML Schema definition for the _update_ element:

[source,xml]
----
 <xsd:complexType name="updateType">
   <xsd:attribute name="recheckAfter" type="xsd:string" /> # <1>
   <xsd:attribute name="rescan" type="xsd:token"/> # <2>
   <xsd:attribute name="trigger" type="collectionUpdateType"/> # <3>
   <xsd:attribute name="startup" type="collectionUpdateType"/> # <4>
 </xsd:complexType>
----

<1>  *recheckAfter*: This will cause a new scan whenever a request comes in and this much time has elapsed since the last scan. The request will wait
until the scan is finished and a new collection is built (if needed), and so is called _synchronous updating_. *This option will be ignored if you
are using the rescan attribute or if you have a tdm element.*
<2>  *rescan*: uses a http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/docs/tutorials/crontrigger.html[cron expression] to specify when the collection should be
rescanned in a background task, and testsed to see if it has changed. This is called _asynchronous updating_.
<3>  *trigger*: if set to "allow" (default), then external triggering will be allowed. This allows collections to be updated by an external program
(or person using a browser) sending an explicit "trigger" URL to the server. This URL is protected by HTTPS, so you must <<trigger,enable
triggers>> for this to work. Set this to "false" to disable triggering.
<4>  *startup*: [_never_ | _nocheck_ | _testIndexOnly_ | _test_ | _always_] (default _never_). The collection is read on server startup, and tested whether
it is up to date, depending on the <<collectionUpdateType>>

If there is no update element, then the dataset is considered _static_, and will not be updated by the TDS.
However the TDS will re-read the dataset if it receives an <<trigger, external trigger>>.

==== *collectionUpdateType* [[collectionUpdateType]]

[source,xml]
----
 <xsd:simpleType name="collectionUpdateType">
   <xsd:union memberTypes="xsd:token">
     <xsd:simpleType>
       <xsd:restriction base="xsd:token">
         <xsd:enumeration value="never"/>
         <xsd:enumeration value="nocheck"/>
         <xsd:enumeration value="testIndexOnly"/>
         <xsd:enumeration value="test"/>
         <xsd:enumeration value="always"/>
       </xsd:restriction>
     </xsd:simpleType>
   </xsd:union>
 </xsd:simpleType>
----

. *_never_*: the collection is used as it is, and no checking is done. The collection index must already exist.
Use this for very large collections that you dont want to inadvertently scan.
. *_nocheck_*: the collection index is used if it exists, without checking whether its up-to-date. If it doesnt exist, build it.
. *_testIndexOnly_*: the collection index is used if it exists and it is newer than all of its immediate children.
. *_test_* or *_true_*: the collection's data files are scanned and the new collection of children is compared to the old collection. If there are any
changes, the index is rebuilt.
. *_always_*: the collection is always rescanned and the indices are rebuilt.

=== *tdm* element (GRIB only)

You must use the *tdm* element for GRIB collections that change. The <<TDM#,TDM>> is a separate process that uses the same configuration
catalogs as the TDS, and updates GRIB collections in the background. Example:

[source,xml]
----
 <tdm rewrite="test" rescan="0 4,19,34,49 * * * ? *"  />
----

* This example tells the TDM (not the TDS) to test if the dataset has changed 4 times every hour, specifically, at 4,19,34, and 49 minutes past the
hour. If the collection has changed, new indices will be recreated, and a trigger will be sent to the TDS.
* The TDM uses the trigger *\https://server/thredds/admin/collection/trigger?collection=_name_&trigger=nocheck* .
It is sent when the TDM has done a rescan, the collection has changed, and a new collection index was made.
The trigger tells the TDS to read in the new collection index.

The XML Schema definition for the _tdm_ element:

[source,xml]
----
 <xsd:complexType name="tdmType">
   <xsd:attribute name="rewrite" type="collectionUpdateType"/> # <1>
   <xsd:attribute name="rescan" type="xsd:token"/> # <2>
 </xsd:complexType>
----

<1>  **rewrite**: one of the link:#collectionUpdateType[collectionUpdateTypes], except for *_never_*. The most useful value is *_test_*.
<2>  **rescan**: uses a http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/docs/tutorials/crontrigger.html[cron expression] to specify when the collection should be
rescanned.

=== *fileSort* element

When a collection shows a list of files, the files will be sorted by increasing name. To use a decreasing sort, use the *_fileSort_* element
inside the featureCollection element:

[source,xml]
----
 <featureCollection ... >
   ...
   <filesSort increasing = "false" />
 </featureCollection>
----

== Date Extractor

Feature Collections sometimes (Point, FMRC, and time partitioned GRIB) need to know how to sort the collection of files, and in those cases
you need to have a date in the filename, and to specify a date extractor in the specification string or include a dateFormatMark attribute.

If the date is in the filename only, you can use the <<CollectionSpecification#,collection specification>> string, aka a **_spec_**:

 /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/GFS/Alaska_191km/GFS_Alaska_191km_#yyyyMMdd_HHmm#\.nc$

applied to the file _/data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/GFS/Alaska_191km/GFS_Alaska_191km_20111226_1200.grib1_ this would extract the date _2011-11-26T12:00:00._

In this case, #_yyyyMMdd_HHmm_# is *positional*: it counts the charactors before the '#' and then extracts the charactors in the filename (here at
position 17 though 30) and applies the <<SimpleDateFormat#,SimpleDateFormat>> _yyyyMMdd_HHmm_ pattern to them.

When the date is in the directory name and not in the filename, you must use the *dateFormatMark*. For example with a file path

 /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/GFS/Alaska_191km/20111226/Run_1200.grib1

use

 dateFormatMark="#Alaska_191km/#yyyyMMdd'/Run_'HHmm"

In this case, the _'#'_ characters delineate the *substring match* on the entire pathname. Immediately following the match comes the string to be
given to <<SimpleDateFormat#,SimpleDateFormat>>, in this example:

 yyyyMMdd'/Run_'HHmm

Note that the _/Run__ is enclosed in single quotes. This tells SimpleDateFormat to interpret these characters literally, and they must match
characters in the filename exactly.

You might also need to put the SimpleDateFormat before the substring match, eg in the following, _stuff_ differs for each subdirectory, so you can't
match on it:

 /dataroot/stuff/20111226/Experiment-02387347.grib1

However, you can match on _Experiment_ so you can use:

 dateFormatMark="yyyyMMdd#/Experiment#"

Note that whatever you match on must be unique in the pathname.

== External Triggers [[trigger]]

The TDS supports a REST interface that allows authorized users to send a _trigger_ to the TDS to tell it to reread a feature collection.
The URL for the trigger is *\https://server/thredds/admin/collection/trigger?collection=_name_&trigger=_type_*, where _name_ is the collection
name, and _type_ is a <<collectionUpdateType>>.

Typically the trigger is used by the TDM, but it can also be used manually or by another program.

.  Triggering is password protected and uses SSH (see <<../RemoteManagement.adoc#,enabling Remote Management>> to enable SSH).
.  You must give the role *_tdsTrigger_* to any user you want to have the right to send a trigger.
. To enable the TDM trigger, create a user named *_tdm_* and give that user the _tdsTrigger_ role.
.  You can see a list of the Feature Collection datasets (and manually send a _trigger=nocheck_ to specific datasets) from the TDS _admin page_ at
_\https://server/thredds/admin/debug?Collections/showCollection_. To have access to this page the user must have the role *_tdsConfig_*
(see <<../RemoteManagement.adoc#,enabling Remote Management>>).

== Static vs. changing datasets (Not GRIB) [[changing]]

=== Static Collection - Small or Rarely Used

If you have a collection that doesn't change, do not include an *update* element. The first time that the dataset is accessed, it will be read in and
then never changed.

=== Static Collection - Fast response

If you have a collection that doesn't change, but you want to have it ready for requests, then use:

 <update startup ="always" />

The dataset will be scanned at startup time and then never changed.

=== Large Static Collection

You have a large collection, which takes a long time to scan. You must carefully control when/if it will be scanned.

 <update startup ="nocheck" />

The dataset will be read in at startup time by using the existing indexes (if they exist). If indexes dont exist, they will be created on startup.

If it occasionally changes, then you want to manually tell it when to rescan:

 <update startup ="nocheck" trigger="allow" />

The dataset will be read in at startup time by using the existing indexes, and you manually tell it when to rebuild the index. You must
link:#trigger[enable triggers].

=== Changing Collection - Small or Rarely Used

For collections that change but are rarely used, use the *recheckAfter* ** attribute on the *update* element. This minimizes unneeded processing
for lightly used collections. This is also a reasonable strategy for small collections which don't take very long to scan.

 <update recheckAfter="15 min" />

Do not include both a *recheckAfter* and a *rescan* attribute. If you do, the *recheckAfter* will be ignored.

=== Changing Collection - Fast response

When you want to ensure that requests are answered as quickly as possible, read it at startup and also update the collection in the background using
*rescan*:

 <update startup="test" rescan="0 20 * * * ? *" />

This http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/docs/tutorials/crontrigger.html[cron expression] says to rescan the collection files every hour at 20 past the
hour, and rebuild the dataset if needed.

=== Sporadically changing Collection

To externally control when a collection is updated, <<trigger,enable remote triggers>>, and when the dataset changes,
send a trigger to the TDS.

== Static vs. changing GRIB datasets

=== Changing GRIB Collection

You have a GRIB collection that changes. The TDS can only scan/write indices at startup time. You must use the TDM to detect any changes.

 <tdm rewrite="test" rescan="0 0/15 * * * ? *" />

The dataset will be read in at startup time by the TDS using the existing indexes, and will be scanned by the <<TDM#,TDM>> every 15 minutes,
which will send a trigger as needed.

=== Very Large GRIB Collection that doesn't change

You have a very large collection, which takes a long time to scan. You must carefully control when/if it will be scanned.

 <update startup="never"/>
 <tdm rewrite="test"/>

The TDS never scans the collection, it always uses existing indices, which must already exist.
Run the TDM first, then after the indices are made, you can stop the TDM and start the TDS.

=== Very Large GRIB Collection that changes

You have a very large collection which changes, and takes a long time to scan. You must carefully control when/if it will be scanned.

 <update startup="never" trigger="allow"/>
 <tdm rewrite="test" rescan="0 0 3 * * ? *" />

The dataset will be read in at TDS startup time by using the existing indexes which must exist. The <<TDM#,TDM>> will test if its changed once a day
at 3 am, and send a trigger to the TDS if needed.

== NcML Modifications [[ncml]]

NcML is no longer used to define the collection, but it may still be used to modify the feature collection dataset, for FMRC or Point (not GRIB).

----

<1>  The collection is defined by a _collection_ element, allowing any number of forecast times per file
<2>  When you want __to modify the component files of the collection__, you put an NcML element inside the _featureCollection_ element. This modifies
the component files before they are turned into a gridded dataset. In this case we haved fixed the time coordinate units attribute, otherwise the
individual files would not get recognized as Grid datasets, and the feature collection will fail.
<3>  When you want _to modify the resulting FMRC dataset,_ you put an NcML element inside the _protoDataset_ element. In this case we have added a
global attribute named _speech_ and 2 attributes on the variable named __mixed_layer_depth__.
