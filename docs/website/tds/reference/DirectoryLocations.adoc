= Location of TDS Directories

'''''

For performance and space reasons, you may want some TDS directories on
larger and higher performance disks than the directory where Tomcat is
installed. For instance:

* The TDS configuration directory (`content/thredds`).
* The Tomcat logs directory (`${tomcat_home}/logs`).
* Data directories

== Using Symbolic Links to Move Non-data Directories

The easiest way to change the location of non-data directories is with
symbolic links. For instance, if Tomcat is installed on a smaller and/or
lower performance disk (say `/opt`) but `/data` is a larger and higher
performance disk, your `${tomcat_home}` directory might look something
like this:

== Using tds.content.root.path to change the location of the configuration directory

* You _must_ set the *_tds.content.root.path_* Java system property.
For instance, by adding the following to JAVA_OPTS in your startup script:
+
-------------------------------------------
-Dtds.content.root.path=/some/absolute/path
-------------------------------------------
+
the TDS will use or create (if they don’t already exist) the
configuration files in:
+
---------------------------
/some/absolute/path/thredds
---------------------------

== Locations of Data Directories

The location of your data directories is configured in your
<<CatalogConfiguration#,configuration catalog(s)>>. So, if your
data is located in `/data/pub`, you simply use the appropriate
`/data/pub` locations in your various dataset configurations
(`datasetRoot`, `datasetScan`, and `featureCollection` elements).

== Location of cache Directories

The various cache directories (`agg/`, `cdm/`, `wcs/` e.g.) can be
configured with the `dir` child element of the various caching elements
in the <<ThreddsConfigXMLFile#,`threddsConfig.xml`>> file.
However, *we recommend* using a symbolic link to move `content/thredds`
instead (more detail
<<ThreddsConfigXMLFile#Cache_Locations,here>>).

== TDS Configuration Directory

The TDS configuration directory is created and populated with default
files the first time the TDS is deployed. It is persistent even when a
TDS installation is upgraded or re-deployed. All modifications and
additions to the TDS configuration should be made in this directory. Do
not place files containing passwords or anything else with security
issues in this directory. Typically you will only be adding and
modifying catalogs and configuration files.

When there are many catalogs, you may want to keep them in separate
subdirectories of the TDS configuration directory. This is recommended
practice. However, do not use a subdirectory
*`content/thredds/catalog`*, as `catalog` is a reserved word in this
context.

When the TDS is first deployed, the TDS configuration directory looks
like:

* `${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/`
** `catalog.xml ` - the main TDS configuration catalog (root catalog for
TDS configuration)
** `enhancedCatalog.xml` - an example catalog [Note: It is referenced
from `catalog.xml`.]
** `threddsConfig.xml` - configuration file for allowing non-default
services, configuring caching, etc (<<ThreddsConfigXMLFile#,more
detailed information>>).
** `logs/`
*** `catalogInit.log` - log file for messages generated while reading
TDS configuration catalogs during TDS initialization and
reinitialization.
*** `threddsServlet.log` - TDS error log file.
** `cache/` - various cache directories
*** `agg/`
*** `cdm/`
*** `collection/`
*** `ehcache/`
*** `ncss/`
*** `wcs/`
