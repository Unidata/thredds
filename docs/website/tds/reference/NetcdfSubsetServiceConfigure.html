<h1>Configuring the NetCDF Subset Service </h1>
<hr>

<p>The Netcdf Subset Service (NCSS) is one of the ways that the TDS can serve data. It is an
    experimental REST protocol for returning subsets of CDM datasets. We want to eventually serve all
    <a href="../../netcdf-java/CDM/index.html">CDM</a>-compatible datasets through NCSS, but right now there are some
    <a href="#restrictions">restrictions</a> on the types of datasets that are supported.</p>

<p>This documentation is for TDS administrators. If you are a client wanting to access data
    through the Netcdf Subset Service, look at
    <a href="NetcdfSubsetServiceReference.html">NetCDF Subset Service Reference</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="enable">Enabling the Netcdf Subset Service in the TDS</a></h2>

<p>The netCDF Subset Service must be enabled in the <code>threddsConfig.xml</code> configuration
    file before it can be used. This is done by adding an <strong>allow</strong> element to the
    <strong>NetcdfSubsetService</strong> element as follows:</p>

<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">&lt;NetcdfSubsetService&gt;<br>    &lt;allow&gt;true&lt;/allow&gt;<br>&lt;/NetcdfSubsetService&gt;</pre>

<p>Note: Details on other configuration options for NCSS are available in the
    <a href="ThreddsConfigXMLFile.html#ncss">threddsConfig.xml</a> docs.</p>

<h2><a name="serving">Serving Datasets with the Netcdf Subset Service</a></h2>

<p>In your configuration catalogs, you must define the service like this: </p>

<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">&lt;service name="subsetServer" serviceType="<strong>NetcdfSubset</strong>" base="<strong>/thredds/ncss/</strong>" /&gt;</pre>

<p>Then as usual, add the service to any datasets that you want served, eg:</p>

<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">&lt;dataset name="datasetName" ID="datasetID" urlPath="/my/urlPath"&gt; <br>   &lt;serviceName&gt;<strong>subsetServer</strong>&lt;/serviceName&gt; <br>&lt;/dataset&gt; </pre>

<p>Note that the name of the service ( <em>subsetServer</em> in this example) is arbitrary,
    but the <strong>serviceType </strong>and<strong> base </strong>must be exactly as shown. </p>

<h2><a name="restrictions">Restrictions on what files can be served</a></h2>

<p>
    First, only datasets in the format that the CDM can read are supported. Second, the data must represent one of the
    following <a href="../../netcdf-java/reference/FeatureDatasets/Overview.html">Feature Types</a>: GRID, POINT,
    STATION.
</p>

<h3>Verifying that a dataset is gridded</h3>

<p>Open your file in the
    <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/webstart/netCDFtools.jnlp">NetCDF ToolsUI
        program</a>,
    using the <em><strong>FeatureTypes->Grids</strong></em> tab. Any fields identified as grids will
    show up in the top table. To be sure, go into the viewer (click
    <img src="images/redraw.gif" alt="Redraw" align="middle" height="20" width="20">
    to bring up the Viewer, then click
    <img src="images/redraw.gif" alt="Redraw" align="middle" height="20" width="20">
    again to show the data) and make sure the data is displayed correctly. If all that works,
    then the data should be served correctly by the TDS.</p>

<h3>Verifying that a dataset is "pointed"</h3>

<p>Open your file in the ToolsUI program using the FeatureTypes->PointFeature tab. In the top table, verify that
    "featureType" is either "POINT" or "STATION".
