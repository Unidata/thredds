<h1 id="UserGuidefortheGodiva2webclient">User Guide for the Godiva2 web client</h1>
<p>
    This is a guide to getting the most out of the Godiva2 web client that
    allows users to visualize data from ncWMS servers interactively.
</p>
<p>
    Most of the controls on the Godiva2 interface have tool tips to help you: hover the
    mouse over the control in question to find out what it does.
</p>

<h2 id="Basicusage">Basic usage</h2>
<p>
    Use the left-hand menu to select a variable for viewing (click on the variable's
    name in the tree view).  The data should appear on the interactive map after a
    short delay (a progress bar may appear showing the progress of loading image tiles
    from the WMS server(s)).  Currently only one variable can be displayed at a time.
</p>
<h3 id="Navigatingthemap">Navigating the map</h3>
<p>
    The interactive map can be dragged with the mouse to navigate around.  Using the
    controls in the top left of the map you can zoom in and out.  You can zoom quickly
    to a particular area by holding down Shift and dragging a rectangle on the map.
    You can automatically centre the current data overlay on the map by clicking "Fit
    layer to window" (above the map).
</p>
<h3 id="Selectingtheverticallevel">Selecting the vertical level</h3>
<p>
    If the variable you are viewing has a vertical dimension you will be able to select
    the vertical level using the drop-down box above the map.
</p>
<h3 id="Selectingthetimestep">Selecting the timestep</h3>
<p>
    If the displayed variable has a time dimension a calendar control will appear above
    the map. Click on this control to select the date you wish to focus on.  If there
    are several timesteps available for this day, use the drop-down box above the map to
    select the time.  See below for instructions on creating animations and timeseries plots.
</p>
<h3 id="Findingthedatavalueatapoint">Finding the data value at a point</h3>
<p>
    Once a variable has been displayed on the map, you can click on the map to discover
    the data value at that point.  The data value, along with the latitude and longitude
    of the point you clicked, will appear in a small pop-up window at the point where you
    clicked.
</p>
<h2 id="Changingthestyleofthedatadisplay">Changing the style of the data display</h2>
<h3 id="Adjustingthecolourcontrastrange">Adjusting the colour contrast range</h3>
<p>
    When you first load up a variable it will appear with a default colour scale range.
    This range may not be appropriate for the geographical region and timestep you are
    interested in.  By clicking "auto" (to the right of the colour scale bar) the colour
    scale range will be automatically stretched to suit the data currently displayed in
    the map.  You can also manually change the colour scale range by editing the values at
    the top and bottom of the colour scale bar.  A third way to adjust the colour scale
    range is to click on the map at any point.  The small pop-up window contains links
    ("Set colour max" and "Set colour min") that you can click to set the upper or lower
    extreme of the colour scale to the data value at that point.
</p>
<h3 id="Lockingthescalerange">Locking the scale range</h3>
<p>
    Sometimes, when comparing two datasets, you might want to fix the colour scale range
    so that when you select a new variable, that variable is shaded with exactly the same
    colour scale.  To do this, click the "lock" link, which is to the right of the colour
    scale bar.  The colour scale range will then not be changed when a new variable is
    loaded and the scale range cannot be edited manually.  Click "unlock" to make the
    colour scale editable again.

</p>
<h3 id="Changingthecolourpalette">Changing the colour palette</h3>
<p>
    The colour palette can be changed by clicking on the colour scale bar.  A pop-up window
    will appear with the available palettes.  Click on one to load the new palette.  The
    window also contains a drop-down box to select the number of colour bands to use, from
    10 (giving a contoured appearance) to 254 (smoothed).
</p>
<h3 id="Otherparameters">Other parameters</h3>
<p>
    Certain variables, particularly biological parameters, are best displayed with a
    logarithmic colour scale.  The spacing of the colour scale can be toggled between
    linear and logarithmic using the drop-down box to the right of the colour scale bar.
    Note that you cannot select a logarithmic scale if the colour scale range contains
    negative or zero values.
</p>
<h2 id="Creatinganimations">Creating animations</h2>
<ol><li>Select the first timestep for your animation using the calendar control as described above.
</li><li>Click "first frame" (above the map).
</li><li>Select the last timestep for your animation.
</li><li>Click "last frame".
</li><li>Click "Create animation".  Note that the animation may take quite a while to appear.
</li><li>Click "Stop animation" (above the map) to stop the animation and return the controls to normal.
</li></ol><h2 id="Timeseriesplots">Timeseries plots</h2>
<p>
    Follow steps 1. to 4. in "Creating animations" above.  Then click on the map to select a
    data point and bring up the small pop-up, which will have a link "Create timeseries plot".  Click this to bring up a pop-up window displaying a timeseries of the data value at the selected point over the selected time range.
</p>
<h2 id="Verticalsectionsandtransectsalongarbitrarypaths">Vertical sections and transects
    along arbitrary paths</h2>
<p>
    At the top of the map itself, select the icon that looks like a line joining four
    points.  Click on the map to start drawing a line.  Add "waypoints" along this line by
    single-clicking at each point.  Double-click to finish the line.  A pop-up will appear
    showing the variation of the viewed variable along the line (i.e. a transect plot).  If
    the variable has a vertical dimension, a vertical section plot will appear under the
    transect plot.
</p>
<h2 id="Changingthebackgroundmap">Changing the background map</h2>
<p>
    A selection of background maps are available on which data can be projected.  Select
    a different background map by clicking the small plus sign in the top right-hand corner
    of the interactive map.
</p>
<h2 id="Changingthemapprojection">Changing the map projection</h2>
<p>
    The map projection is changed by selecting a new background map as above.  If the
    background map is in a different projection then the data overlay will be automatically
    reprojected into the new coordinate system.  Commonly, Godiva2 websites will give the
    option to select a background map in north or south polar stereographic projection.  There
    may be a delay before the map appears in the new projection.
</p>
<h2 id="Savingandemailingtheview">Saving and emailing the view</h2>
<p>
    You may wish to save the current view to return to it later or share it with a colleague.
    The "Permalink" under the bottom right-hand corner of the map links to a complete URL
    that, when loaded, recreates the current view.  Left-click on the permalink to bring up
    a new window with an identical view.  Right-click on the permalink and select "Copy
    link location" or the equivalent for your web browser.  You can then paste the link
    into a report, your notes or an email.  You can also click on "email" (next to the
    permalink) to start a new email message in your default email client with the permalink
    already included in the message body.
