<h1>Server Performance </h1>

<hr>
<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>Throw more $$ at this problem, hardware is cheap, compared to people. </p>

<p>It would be highly unusual for the TDS not to be I/O bound, so buying a high-performance disk subsystem is much better than buying fast CPUs. Slower, more
  energy efficient multicore processors are optimized for web server loads. </p>

<p>Typically disk access is much faster on a local drive than on an NFS mounted drive. High performance disk subsystems like RAID or SANs will significantly
  improve TDS throughput. </p>

<h2>Operating System Configuration</h2>

<h3>Use a 64-bit OS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>'nuff said</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use a high-performance file system</h3>

<p>If you have system admin resources, examine the possible file systems available for your OS, eg on Linux or Solaris. We are using the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS file system</a> on Solaris-X86 and it is very fast. We
  use<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/ds/zfs.jsp"> ZFS software RAID</a>, which replaces hardware RAID.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Setting the number of file handles</h3>

<p> The OS typically limits the number of open file handles per process. To check this value on Unix, use:</p>
<pre> ulimit -n </pre>
<p>If you are using the default <a href="ThreddsConfigXMLFile.html#FileCache">TDS configuration values</a>, this value should be 1024 or greater. Otherwise
  you can tune this number based on your own settings. For example, to set this value to 2048 in the <em><strong>tomcat startup.sh</strong></em> script:</p>
<pre> ulimit -n 2048</pre>
<p>This affects the number of files to keep in the <a href="#cache">File  Handle Caches</a>. </p>

<h2><a name="jvm">Java Virtual Machine</a></h2>

<h3>Use a 64-bit JVM with -server</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You may have to examine the docs for your JVM on how to do this. Below are the options we use for Sun Solaris 1.6 JVM, which requires -d64 to run the 64
    bit version
  </li>
  <li>You should run with the Java HotSpot Server VM, by using the <strong>-server</strong> option. </li>
  <li>You should give the JVM as much memory as possible. Here we give it 4 Gbytes. The maximum you can use for 32-bit JVMs seems to be around 1500 Mbytes</li>
</ul>
<pre>-d64 -Xmx4081m -Xms512m -server -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Djava.awt.headless=true</pre>
<ul>
  <li>-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError triggers a heap dump when you run out of memory. We recommend the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mat/">Memory
    Analyser</a> from Eclipse to explore heap dumps.
  </li>
  <li>-Djava.awt.headless=true tells the system that there is not a graphics console being used, which avaois some arcane errors from third party libraries.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend the latest version of JDK 8, and soon we will require it.</p>

<h2>Tomcat</h2>

<h3>Version</h3>

<p>We recommend the latest stable version of Tomcat 7. This requires JDK 1.6 or above. </p>

<h3><a name="enableCompression"></a>Compression</h3>

<p>Tomcat can be configured to automatically compress the responses, whenever the client allows that. Compression is usually a big win, especially for
  bandwidth-limited sites. Deciding when and what to compress depends on a lot of factors, however. We use the following settings in <strong>server.xml</strong>:
</p>
<pre>    &lt;!-- non-SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8080 --&gt;<br>    &lt;Connector port=&quot;8080&quot;<br>               protocol=&quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;<br>               maxThreads=&quot;50&quot;<br>               connectionTimeout=&quot;20000&quot;<br>               redirectPort=&quot;8443&quot;<br>               <strong>compression=&quot;1000&quot;
               compressableMimeType=&quot;text/html,text/xml,text/plain,application/octet-stream&quot;</strong> /&gt;
<br></pre>
<p>This says to compress (gzip or deflate) when the number of bytes is &gt;= 1000, for the named mime-types. See Tomcat
  <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/http.html">HTTP Connector reference</a> page for more details.</p>

<h3>Automatic Startup </h3>

<p>In a production environment, Tomcat should be automatically restarted when the machine starts. How to do this depends on what OS you are running. This
  <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-tomcat/HowTo">FAQ</a> has a bit of info. </p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>Once <strong>thredds.war</strong> is expanded, manually copy everything in <strong>${tomcat_home}/webapps/thredds/initialContent/root/ </strong>to <strong>${tomcat_home}/webapps/ROOT/
  .</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>This sets up a <strong>robots<a name="robots"></a>.txt</strong> file to keep crawlers from wasting bandwidth.</li>
  <li> The <strong>favicon.ico</strong> file is mostly a convenience to keep browsers from constantly asking for it (substitute your own icon if you like!).
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Thredds Data Server </h2>

<h3><a name="cache"></a>File Handles and Caching </h3>

<p>The TDS caches file handles to minimize OS overhead. Currently the defaults assume that the tomcat process is limited to 1024 file handles. If you can allow more, you can increase the sizes of the FileCaches for more performance. You can change these settings in the <a href="ThreddsConfigXMLFile.html#FileCache">threddsConfig.xml</a> file. </p>

<p>These numbers limit performance, but not functionality. For example, the number of files in an aggregation is not limited by these file handle limits.</p>
<p>Each NetcdfFile object encapsolates a file. NcML aggregations are careful not to keep component files open. When number of cache files &gt;
  maxElementsInMemory, a cleanup thread starts after 100 msecs. So the number of cached files can get larger than maxElementsInMemory in the interim, but unless
  you are really hammering the OS by opening many files per scond, it shouldnt get too much bigger. But leave some cushion, depending on your expected rate of
  opening files. </p>

<h3>Consolidate cache / temporary directories</h3>

<p>The TDS writes temporary files and caches files. By default these are stored under <strong>${content_root}/thredds/cache. </strong>These directories
  can get large. You might want to relocate them to another place, for example if <strong>${tomcat_home}</strong> has limited space. Also, theres no need to
  backup the cache directories, so they can be placed on a disk that is not backed up. The easiest thing to do is to create a symbolic link from <strong>${content_root}/thredds/cache</strong>
  to wherever you want thes files to live.</p>

<h3>OPeNDAP Memory Use</h3>

<p>The OPeNDAP-Java layer of the server currently has to read the entire data request into memory before sending it to the client (we hope to get a streaming
  I/O solution working eventually). Generally clients only request subsets of large files, but if you need to support large data requests, make sure that the
  <em><strong>-Xmx</strong></em> parameter above is set accordingly. </p>

<h3>Pre-indexing GRIB files</h3>

<p>If you are serving GRIB files through any of the subsetting services (OPENDAP, WCS, etc), the CDM must write indices the first time it tries to read it.
  This can take several minutes for very large GRIB files. For large aggregations and <a href="collections/FeatureCollections.html">collections</a>, this can take hours or even days. By indexing GRIB files before they are accessed with the <a href="collections/TDM.html">TDM</a>, users get much faster response time. As of TDS 4.6+ f these collections change, you must use the TDM to detect those changes, the TDS will no longer update GRIB collections on the fly.</p>
