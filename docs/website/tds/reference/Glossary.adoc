== W3C Date [[W3C_Date]]

For our purposes, a W3C Date, which is a profile of an ISO Date, can be a dateTime or a date:

*A dateTime* has the form: `'-'? yyyy '-' mm '-' dd 'T' hh ':' mm ':' ss ('.' s+)? (zzzzzz)?`

where:

* `'-'? yyyy` is a four-or-more digit, optionally negative-signed numeral that represents the year;
if more than four digits, leading zeros are prohibited, and `'0000'` is prohibited (see the Note above http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#year-zero[(3.2.7)];
also note that a plus sign is *not* permitted);
* the remaining `'-'` are separators between parts of the date portion;
* the first `mm` is a two-digit numeral that represents the month;
* `dd` is a two-digit numeral that represents the day;
* `'T'` is a separator indicating that time-of-day follows;
* `hh` is a two-digit numeral that represents the hour;
`'24'` is permitted if the minutes and seconds represented are zero, and the *dateTime* value
so represented is the first instant of the following day (the hour property of a *dateTime* object in the
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dt-value-space[value space] cannot have a value greater than 23);
* `':'` is a separator between parts of the time-of-day portion;
* the second `mm` is a two-digit numeral that represents the minute;
* `ss` is a two-integer-digit numeral that represents the whole seconds;
* `'.' s+` (if present) represents the fractional seconds;
* `zzzzzz` (if present) represents the time zone (as described below).

For example, `2002-10-10T12:00:00-05:00` (noon on 10 October 2002, Central Daylight Savings Time as well as Eastern Standard Time in the U.S.) is
`2002-10-10T17:00:00Z`, five hours later than `2002-10-10T12:00:00Z`.

A *date* is the same as a dateTime without the time part : `'-'? yyyy '-' mm '-' dd     zzzzzz?`

== W3C Time Duration [[W3C_Duration]]

The lexical representation for *duration* is the http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#ISO8601[[ISO 8601]] extended format P__n__Y__n__ M__n__DT__n__H
__n__M__n__S, where __n__Y represents the number of years, __n__M the number of months, __n__D the number of days, 'T' is the date/time separator,
__n__H the number of hours, __n__M the number of minutes and __n__S the number of seconds. The number of seconds can include decimal digits to
arbitrary precision.

The values of the Year, Month, Day, Hour and Minutes components are not restricted but allow an arbitrary unsigned integer, i.e., an integer that conforms to the pattern `[0-9]+`.
Similarly, the value of the Seconds component allows an arbitrary unsigned decimal.
According to http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#ISO8601[[ISO 8601]], at least one digit must follow the decimal point if it appears.
That is, the value of the Seconds component must conform to the pattern `[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?`.
Thus, the lexical representation of *duration* does not follow the alternative format of 5.5.3.2.1 in http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#ISO8601[[ISO 8601]].

An optional preceding minus sign (`-`) is allowed, to indicate a negative duration. If the sign is omitted, a positive duration is indicated. See also
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#isoformats[ISO 8601 Date and Time Formats (D)].

For example, to indicate a duration of 1 year, 2 months, 3 days, 10 hours, and 30 minutes, one would write: `P1Y2M3DT10H30M`.
One could also indicate a duration of minus 120 days as: `-P120D`.

Reduced precision and truncated representations of this format are allowed provided they conform to the following:

* If the number of years, months, days, hours, minutes, or seconds in any expression equals zero,
the number and its corresponding designator may be omitted. However, at least one number and its designator must be present.
* The seconds part may have a decimal fraction.
* The designator 'T' must be absent if and only if all of the time items are absent. The designator 'P' must always be present.

For example, `P1347Y`, `P1347M`, and `P1Y2MT2H` are all allowed, as are `P0Y1347M` and `P0Y1347M0D`.

`P-1347M` is not allowed although `-P1347M` is. `P1Y2MT` is not.

See XML Schema http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration[duration] for full details.
