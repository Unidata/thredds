<h1>TDS Configuration Catalogs</h1>
<hr>
<p>TDS is configured with <em>configuration catalogs</em> that live in the directory <strong>${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/</strong> and its subdirectories.
  These  contain  information needed only on the server, which
  is removed when the TDS sends the <em>client catalog</em> to the requester. </p>

<h3>Configuration Catalogs</h3>

<p>The <em>default root catalog</em> is <strong>${content_root}/thredds/catalog.xml</strong>. It may reference other configuration catalogs using the
  <strong>catalogRef</strong>
  element. These catalogs can also contain catalogRef elements, etc. If
  you want to serve other catalogs that are not linked to the root
  catalog, then <a href="../tutorial/ConfigCatalogs.html#rootCatalogs">declare them</a> in <strong>${content_root}/thredds/threddsConfig.xml</strong>. The
  set of configuration catalogs is found by traversing all the root catalogs. This is the set of <em>configuration catalogs</em>, aka <em>static catalogs</em>.
</p>

<p><em>All catalogs that you want to be seen and indexed (eg by crawlers) should be linked from the root catalog. Only declare catalogs in a catalogRoot element
  when you want to &quot;hide&quot; the catalog from simple browse access</em>.</p>

<p>A catalogRef element looks like: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><strong>&lt;catalogRef xlink:href=&quot;idd/models.xml&quot; xlink:title=&quot;NCEP Model Data&quot; name=&quot;&quot; /&gt;</strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>xlink:href </strong>attribute names the referenced catalog; it must be relative to the catalog it is contained in. In this example, it would be
  in the subdirectory <strong>idd</strong> under the directory of the catalog containing it . You can also use &quot;..&quot; to name peer directories:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><strong>&lt;catalogRef xlink:href=&quot;../idv/ncep.xml&quot; xlink:title=&quot;IDV NCEP Model Data&quot; name=&quot;&quot; /&gt;</strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>in this example, if the catalog is <strong>${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/idd/models.xml, </strong>then the referenced catalog is <strong>${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/idv/ncep.xml</strong>
</p>

<p>You can also use a relative URL that begins with <code>/</code> (a slash):</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><strong>&lt;catalogRef xlink:href=&quot;/thredds/galeon/wcs/test.xml&quot; xlink:title=&quot;GALEON Test Data&quot; name=&quot;&quot; /&gt;</strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>which points to the catalog at <strong>${content_root}/thredds/galeon/wcs/test.xml </strong>no matter what catalog it appears in. Note that the base
  directory is <strong>${content_root}/thredds/</strong>, and that all configuration catalogs must live under it. </p>

<h3>Catalog Caching</h3>

<p>Static catalogs are read and cached in memory when the TDS <em>web application</em> starts up (e.g. when Tomcat starts up). The <em>expires</em> attribute
  can be used to decide whether to reread the catalog. If no expires attribute, the catalog is not automatically reread:</p>
<h3>DatasetScan Dynamic Catalogs </h3>

<p>Dynamic catalogs are generated by <a href="DatasetScan.html">DatasetScan</a> elements, at the time the user request is made. These catalogs are not cached.
  The request causes a single disk directory to be read. Files in the directory (that pass the filter) are made into <em>dataset</em> elements. Any
  subdirectories are made into <em>catalogRef</em> elements, and are not read until a request is made for them. </p>
<h3>Feature Collection Dynamic Catalogs </h3>
<p>Dynamic catalogs are also generated by  <a href="collections/FeatureCollections.html">FeatureCollection</a> elements, at the time the user request is made. Typically the top collection catalog is cached, but not any subcollections.
  Each request typically causes a single collection index file to be read. </p>
