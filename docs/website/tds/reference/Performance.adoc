= Server Performance

'''''

== Hardware

Throw more $$ at this problem, hardware is cheap, compared to people.

It would be highly unusual for the TDS not to be I/O bound, so buying a
high-performance disk subsystem is much better than buying fast CPUs.
Slower, more energy efficient multicore processors are optimized for web
server loads.

Typically disk access is much faster on a local drive than on an NFS
mounted drive. High performance disk subsystems like RAID or SANs will
significantly improve TDS throughput.

== Operating System Configuration

=== Use a 64-bit OS

* ’nuff said

=== Use a high-performance file system

If you have system admin resources, examine the possible file systems
available for your OS, eg on Linux or Solaris. We are using the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS[ZFS file system] on Solaris-X86 and it
is very fast. We use https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1448/index.html[ZFS
software RAID], which replaces hardware RAID.

=== Setting the number of file handles

The OS typically limits the number of open file handles per process. To
check this value on Unix, use:

-----------
 ulimit -n
-----------

If you are using the default
<<ThreddsConfigXMLFile.adoc#FileCache,TDS configuration values>>, this
value should be 1024 or greater. Otherwise you can tune this number
based on your own settings. For example, to set this value to 2048 in
the _*tomcat startup.sh*_ script:

---------------
 ulimit -n 2048
---------------

This affects the number of files to keep in the link:#cache[File Handle
Caches].

== Java Virtual Machine

=== Use a 64-bit JVM with -server

* You may have to examine the docs for your JVM on how to do this. Below
are the options we use for Sun Solaris 1.6 JVM, which requires -d64 to
run the 64 bit version
* You should run with the Java HotSpot Server VM, by using the *-server*
option.
* You should give the JVM as much memory as possible. Here we give it 4
Gbytes. The maximum you can use for 32-bit JVMs seems to be around 1500
Mbytes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-d64 -Xmx4081m -Xms512m -server -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Djava.awt.headless=true
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError triggers a heap dump when you run out
of memory. We recommend the http://www.eclipse.org/mat/[Memory Analyser]
from Eclipse to explore heap dumps.
* -Djava.awt.headless=true tells the system that there is not a graphics
console being used, which avaois some arcane errors from third party
libraries.

We recommend the latest version of JDK 8, and soon we will require it.

== Tomcat

=== Version

We recommend the latest stable version of Tomcat 7. This requires JDK
1.6 or above.

=== Compression

Tomcat can be configured to automatically compress the responses,
whenever the client allows that. Compression is usually a big win,
especially for bandwidth-limited sites. Deciding when and what to
compress depends on a lot of factors, however. We use the following
settings in **server.xml**:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <!-- non-SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8080 -->
    <Connector port="8080"
               protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               maxThreads="50"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               redirectPort="8443"
               compression="1000"
               compressableMimeType="text/html,text/xml,text/plain,application/octet-stream" />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This says to compress (gzip or deflate) when the number of bytes is >=
1000, for the named mime-types. See Tomcat
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/http.html[HTTP Connector
reference] page for more details.

=== Automatic Startup

In a production environment, Tomcat should be automatically restarted
when the machine starts. How to do this depends on what OS you are
running. This http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-tomcat/HowTo[FAQ] has a bit
of info.

=== Miscellaneous

Once *thredds.war* is expanded, manually copy everything in
*$\{tomcat_home}/webapps/thredds/initialContent/root/* to
*$\{tomcat_home}/webapps/ROOT/ .*

1.  This sets up a *robots.txt* file to keep crawlers from wasting
bandwidth.
2.  The *favicon.ico* file is mostly a convenience to keep browsers from
constantly asking for it (substitute your own icon if you like!).

== Thredds Data Server

=== File Handles and Caching

The TDS caches file handles to minimize OS overhead. Currently the
defaults assume that the tomcat process is limited to 1024 file handles.
If you can allow more, you can increase the sizes of the FileCaches for
more performance. You can change these settings in the
<<ThreddsConfigXMLFile.adoc#FileCache,threddsConfig.xml>> file.

These numbers limit performance, but not functionality. For example, the
number of files in an aggregation is not limited by these file handle
limits.

Each NetcdfFile object encapsolates a file. NcML aggregations are
careful not to keep component files open. When number of cache files >
maxElementsInMemory, a cleanup thread starts after 100 msecs. So the
number of cached files can get larger than maxElementsInMemory in the
interim, but unless you are really hammering the OS by opening many
files per scond, it shouldnt get too much bigger. But leave some
cushion, depending on your expected rate of opening files.

=== Consolidate cache / temporary directories

The TDS writes temporary files and caches files. By default these are
stored under *$\{content_root}/thredds/cache.* These directories can get
large. You might want to relocate them to another place, for example if
*$\{tomcat_home}* has limited space. Also, theres no need to backup the
cache directories, so they can be placed on a disk that is not backed
up. The easiest thing to do is to create a symbolic link from
*$\{content_root}/thredds/cache* to wherever you want thes files to
live.

=== OPeNDAP Memory Use

The OPeNDAP-Java layer of the server currently has to read the entire
data request into memory before sending it to the client (we hope to get
a streaming I/O solution working eventually). Generally clients only
request subsets of large files, but if you need to support large data
requests, make sure that the _*-Xmx*_ parameter above is set
accordingly.

=== Pre-indexing GRIB files

If you are serving GRIB files through any of the subsetting services
(OPENDAP, WCS, etc), the CDM must write indices the first time it tries
to read it. This can take several minutes for very large GRIB files. For
large aggregations and
<<collections/FeatureCollections#,collections>>, this can take
hours or even days. By indexing GRIB files before they are accessed with
the <<collections/TDM#,TDM>>, users get much faster response time.
As of TDS 4.6+ f these collections change, you must use the TDM to
detect those changes, the TDS will no longer update GRIB collections on
the fly.
