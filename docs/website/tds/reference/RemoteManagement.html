<h1>Enabling TDS Remote Management
</h1>

<hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>It's very convenient to be able to remotely manage and administer the Tomcat web server, and to remotely
  configure and debug the Thredds Data Server, for example from a web browser running on your desktop.
  However, remote access to the server introduces potential security problems, so by default these
  capabilities are not turned on. You can run Tomcat and TDS quite successfully by editing the
  configuration files on the server, and restarting when needed. </p>

<p>Managing a server is difficult and we recommend that you enable remote management. By following the
  procedures here, you can do so without opening any big security holes. However, you must decide this
  yourself, based on your organization's security policies, and a risk assessment for your server. In what
  follows we try to explain what risks the various options have, as well as we understand them. A good
  compromise may be to do all the work to enable remote management, then turn it on only while actively
  configuring the server, and turn it off when in production mode. </p>

<p>In any case, we strongly recommend that you also read and follow the
  <a href="TomcatSecurity.html">Tomcat/TDS Security guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>Follow the <a href="../tutorial/Checklist.html">checklist</a> for more concise and up-to-date configuration instruction.</p>

<h2>Configuring Tomcat Users </h2>

<p>Special permissions (like remote management) are done in Tomcat by creating <em><strong>users</strong></em> with special <em><strong>roles</strong></em>. As
  long as you also follow the <a href="TomcatSecurity.html">Tomcat/TDS Security guidelines</a>, using the simplest Tomcat mechanism to do this should be safe.
</p>

<p> Edit <strong>${tomcat_home}/conf/tomcat-users.xml</strong>, adding roles "tdsConfig", "manager", &quot;admin&quot;, and users who have those roles, e.g.:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?&gt;<br>&lt;tomcat-users&gt;<br>  &lt;role rolename="manager"/&gt;<br>  &lt;role rolename="admin"/&gt;<br>  &lt;role rolename="tdsConfig"/&gt;
<br>  &lt;user username="admin" password="adminpassword" roles="admin, manager-gui, manager"/&gt;<br>  &lt;user username="yername" password="yerpassword" roles="tdsConfig"/&gt;<br>&lt;/tomcat-users&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em><strong>manager</strong></em>, <em><strong>manager-gui</strong></em>, and <em><strong>admin</strong></em> roles are used within Tomcat itself to
  allow the use of the manager and administrator web interface. The <em><strong>tdsConfig</strong></em> role is used to configure the TDS. These roles must be
  specified exactly as shown. Note that all 3 of these roles are independent - you can add any, all or none of them. The easiest way to enable or disable remote
  administration is to change this file and restart Tomcat.</p>

<p>The list of users, their names and passwords, are whatever you want them to be. Note that after you get this set up, you can manage users remotely through
  the administrator interface. Note also that before you go into production mode, you should change to using digest passwords by following the instructions
  <a href="TomcatSecurity.html#Digest">here</a>. </p>

<p>Note that any changes won't take effect until you restart Tomcat. </p>

<p><strong>Higher Security: </strong>You can also use an LDAP server or a Database to store users and roles, which may give you higher levels of security. Use
  of this feature is beyond the scope of this documentation, however.</p>

<h2><a name="keystore"></a>Enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL<a name="SSL"></a>)</h2>

<p>We ensure that no one can intercept and read sensitive information to and from the server (through doing what's called <em>network sniffing</em>) by
  encrypting the information using SSL. To enable this, do the following: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose a keystore filename <strong><strong> ${keystore_filename}.</strong></strong>
    If this option is not specified, it defaults to <strong>${user_home}/.keystore</strong>.
  <li>Create a certificate by executing the following command:
    <blockquote>
      <pre><strong>${java_home}/bin/keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -validity 365 -<strong>keystore ${keystore_filename}</strong></strong></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p> You will then get a set of prompts:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Enter keystore password: <strong>mypassword</strong></pre>
      <pre>What is your first and last name? [Unknown]: <strong>www.mydomain.edu</strong></pre>
      <pre>What is the name of your organizational unit? [Unknown]: </pre>
      <pre>What is the name of your organization? [Unknown]: </pre>
      <pre>What is the name of your City or Locality? [Unknown]: </pre>
      <pre>What is the name of your State or Province? [Unknown]: </pre>
      <pre>What is the two-letter country code for this unit? [Unknown]: </pre>
      <pre>Is CN=*.ucar.edu, OU=UCAR Web Engineering Group, O=University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, L=Boulder, ST=Colorado, C=US correct?</pre>
      <pre>[no]: yes</pre>
      <pre>Enter key password for &lt;tomcat&gt;</pre>
      <pre>(RETURN if same as keystore password):</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Its not obvious, but the &quot;first and last name&quot; must be the name of your Tomcat server host machine (<strong>www.mydomain.edu</strong> in this
      example). Be sure to specify the same password for both the keystore and the &lt;tomcat&gt; key password (the default is <strong>changeit</strong>). Fill
      out the other values as appropriate. This creates a <em>self-signed certificate</em> and puts it into the
      <strong><strong>${keystore_filename}</strong></strong> keystore. Note the <strong>validity</strong> option on the command line, which is the number of
      days the certificate is valid. </p>
  <li>In <strong>${tomcat_home}/conf/server.xml</strong>, find the following section that configures the SSL port (<strong>not</strong> the regular 8080 port),
    uncomment it, and modify it so it looks like:
    <pre>    &lt;!-- Define a SSL Coyote HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8443 --&gt;<br>    &lt;Connector port=&quot;8443&quot;  protocol=&quot;org.apache.coyote.http11.http11NioProtocol&quot; <br>               SSLEnabled=&quot;true&quot;    <br>               maxThreads=&quot;150&quot; minSpareThreads=&quot;25&quot;<br>               enableLookups=&quot;false&quot; disableUploadTimeout=&quot;true&quot;<br>               acceptCount=&quot;100&quot; scheme=&quot;https&quot; secure=&quot;true&quot;<br>               clientAuth=&quot;false&quot; sslProtocol=&quot;TLS&quot; <strong>keystoreFile=&quot;<strong>${keystore_filename}&quot;</strong>
      keystorePass=&quot;mypassword&quot;</strong>/&gt;</pre>
    This enables Tomcat to use port 8443 for the HTTPS protocol, which uses SSL. All sensitive accesses will get redirected to that port.
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p> See <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/index.html#security">keytool documentation</a> for full description of managing keystores. The
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-7.0-doc/ssl-howto.html">Tomcat doc</a> is quite good, also. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Installing a Certificate from a Certificate Authority</strong></h3>

<p>The use of SSL in this way prevents a network sniffer from getting your password. A more sophisticated (and more difficult to perform) attack is the so
  called <em>man-in-the-middle</em> attack where someone pretends to be your server, and induces your client to send the password to it. </p>

<p>In the above, we used self-signed certificates, and your browser will give you a warning each time you access a web page that uses self-signed certificates.
  It will allow you to choose to continue however, and so a clever enough attacker might induce you to accept their self-signed certificate. To prevent this,
  you can obtain a certificate signed by a <em>Certificate Authority</em> (CA). You can then install it using
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-7.0-doc/ssl-howto.html#Installing%20a%20Certificate%20from%20a%20Certificate%20Authority">these
    instructions</a>. The browser will see that its a valid certificate, and so you will never accept self-signed certificates and you will preclude
  man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>

<p>Obtaining and installing a CA signed certificate is a fair amount of work, but not really all that difficult. We recommend it if you plan on leaving remote
  management enabled in production mode.</p>

<h3>Using the JRE keystore<a name="JRE_keystore"></a></h3>

<p>Third party authentication software such as CAS may require that a remote host's certificate be placed into the JRE keystore. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Obtain the remote host's certificate and place into a temporary file, say <strong>server.crt</strong>. For example, if running a CAS server in Tomcat,
      you want to use the tomcat certificate that we generated above. To extract it, use: </p>
    <pre><strong> keytool -export -alias tomcat -keypass changeit -keystore ${keystore_filename} -file server.crt</strong></pre>

  <li>Import the certificate into the JRE's keystore. Be sure to use the same JRE that Tomcat will run under:
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <pre>  <strong>keytool -import -alias tomcat -keypass changeit -file server.crt -keystore ${jre_home}/lib/security/cacerts</strong>
</pre>
  <p> If there are spaces, you need to quote the filename, eg:</p>
  <pre><strong> -keystore &quot;C:/Program Files (x86)/Java/jdk1.7.0_04/jre/lib/security/cacerts&quot;
  </strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If the certificate is not correctly installed (eg you put it in the wrong JRE), you will get an Exception like:</p>
<pre><strong> sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target</strong></pre>
<h2>Check that the correct ports are enabled</h2>

<p>After restarting Tomcat, you can use <strong>netstat -an </strong>command to check that the ports are correctly configured. You should see lines like:</p>
<pre>  TCP    127.0.0.1:8080         0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
  TCP    127.0.0.1:8443         0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING 
</pre>
<p>You also need to make sure that your firewall is allowing those ports through. </p>

<h2>TDS Remote Debugging<a id="RemoteDebugging"></a></h2>

<p>Once SSL is enabled, you can remotely debug and configure the TDS. You need to login with a user who has the <strong>tdsConfig</strong> role.</p>

<p>Debugging information is available at <strong><a href="http://localhost:8080/thredds/admin/debug">http://localhost:8080/thredds/admin/debug</a>. </strong>
</p>

<p><img src="images/TdsDebug.png" width="828" height="1160"></p>

<p>Some capabilities of particular interest are:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Show Tomcat Logs</strong>: allows you to look at the Tomcat logs in <strong>${tomcat_home}/logs</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Show TDS Log</strong><strong>s:</strong> allows you to look at the TDS logs in <strong>${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/logs</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Show static catalogs: </strong>list all the static (non-dynamic) catalogs read in at startup</li>
  <li><strong>Show data roots:</strong> list all the dataRoots with links to the directories they are mapped to</li>
  <li><strong>Show File Object Caches</strong>: Show all files currently in the object caches</li>
  <li><strong>Clear File Object Caches:</strong> Remove all unlocked files in the object caches</li>
</ol>
<h2>TroubleShooting</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Connection refused when trying to access a restricted page</strong>. The SSL socket is not enabled in the server.xml file, or you didn't install a
    certificate in the keystore.
  </li>
  <li><strong>sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target</strong> : A 3rd party
    security system like CAS is trying to establish an SSL connection. <a href="#JRE_keystore">Install</a> the remote host's certificate into the JRE
    certificate store.
  </li>
  <li><strong>What's in the keystore? </strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Look at the <a href="https://localhost:8443/thredds/admin/debug?General/showServerInfo">Tomcat Server Status</a> page and check the JVM Version.</li>
      <li> From command line, make sure that this matches the results of <strong>'java -version'. </strong>If not, then your Tomcat server is starting up with a
        different JVM.
      </li>
      <li>From command line, <strong>'keytool -list' </strong>will show you what's in the default keystore. Standard is to have password <em>changeit</em>. You
        need an entry named <em>tomcat</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
