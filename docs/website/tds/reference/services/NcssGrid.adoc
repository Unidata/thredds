= NCSS For Grid Data

== Subsetting Parameters for NCSS Grid

These parameters are identical to the CdmrFeature service:

include::CdmrfParams.adoc[]

In addition, NCSS supports these parameters for Grids:

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,30%,30%,10%",options="header",]
|====
| Parameter Name | Required  | Description  | Constraints | default
| *addLatLon* | no |  make output strictly CF compliant by adding lat/lon coordinates if needed. | _true_ or _false_ | false
| *accept* | no | The returned data format. | _netCDF_ or __netCDF4__ |  __netCDF__
|====

Adding Lat/Lon coordinate::

* To be strictly CF compliant, lat/lon coordinates must be present in the netCDF file. For datasets that use a projection, this means that the lat/lon coordinate
will be 2D (lat(y,x), lon(y,x)). Set this parameter to true to add 2D lat/lon coordinates for projected data.

Output Format (_accept_ parameter)::

* _netCDF_: CF/NetCDF-3
* _netCDF4_: CF/NetCDF-4 classic model

== NCSS Grid as Point

If you specify a point location with the _latitude, longitude_ parameters, the request becomes a *grid-as-point* request.
Request parameters are mostly identical to regular NCSS Grid request, but what gets returned is different.
If a netCDF file is requested, it will be written in *_CF / netCDF Discrete Sample Geometry_* format. Other possible return
types are the same as NCSS Point requests.

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,30%,30%,10%",options="header",]
|====
| Parameter Name | Required  | Description  | Constraints | default
| *latitude, longitude* | no | Point location. units of degrees_east, degrees_north | Must be within the dataset bounding box |
| *accept* | no | The returned data format. | _netCDF_, _netCDF4_, _XML_, _CSV_ | _CSV_
|====

* if you specify a point location with the _latitude, longitude_ parameters, the request becomes a grid-as-point request.
Other horizontal subsetting parameters (like lat/lon or projection bounding boxes) are ignored.
* variable with vertical levels will be returned as profiles, unless a specific level is chosen.
* The returned files are written as CF/DSG files, either timeseries (no vertical coordinate) or timeSeriesProfile (if there is a vertical coordinate).

== Use cases

=== Spatial and coordinate subsetting

NCSS provides two types of bounding boxes to subset the data:

. *Lat/lon bounding box* is specified with the params _north, south, east_ and _west._ The _north_ and _south_ parameters are latitude values, and must
be in units of _degrees_north_ and lie between +/- 90. The _east_ and _west_ parameters are longitude values with units of __degrees_east__, and may
be positive or negative, and will be interpreted modulo 360. The requested subset starts at the west longitude and goes eastward until the east
longitude. Therefore, when crossing the dateline, the west edge may be greater than the east edge. For grids, if the underlying dataset is on a
projection, the minimum enclosing projection bounding box will be calculated and used. The data contained in the intersection of this rectangle with
the data is returned. To use, inspect _dataset.xml_ for the <LatLonBox> elements, which indicate the min and max extensions of the grid, for
example:
+
[source,xml]
------------------------
<LatLonBox>
  <west>-153.5889</west>
  <east>-48.5984</east>
  <south>11.7476</south>
  <north>57.4843</north>
</LatLonBox>
------------------------

Example request:

---------------------------------------------
&north=17.3&south=12.088&west=140.2&east=160.0
---------------------------------------------

. *Projection bounding box* (only on grid datasets with projections) is specified with the params _minx, miny, maxx_ and __maxy__. These are projection coordinates in
km on the projection plane; the data contained in the intersection of this rectangle with the data is returned. To use, inspect the dataset.xml for
the <projectionBox> elements, which indicate the min and max extensions of the grid, for example:
+
[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <gridSet name="time layer_between_two_pressure_difference_from_ground_layer y x">
    <projectionBox>
      <minx>-4264.248291015625</minx>
      <maxx>3293.955078125</maxx>
      <miny>-872.8428344726562</miny>
      <maxy>4409.772216796875</maxy>
    </projectionBox>
    ...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example request:

----
&minx=-500&miny=-1600&maxx=500&maxy=0
----

By default, if no spatial subsetting is specified, the service returns all the features in the dataset.


=== Single-point requests

The NetCDF Subset Service allows the user to extract data for a point of interest by specifying its latitude and longitude, which makes it
a _grid-as-point_ service. NCSS will find the grid cell in which the lat/lon falls and return its
data as if it were a _timeseries_ feature (none or one vertical coordinate), or a _timeseriesProfile_ feature.
The supported output formats are _netCDF_, _netCDF4_, _XML_, and _CSV_. Writing to netCDF will return a _CF-DSG/netCDF_ file.
The XML and CSV formats are ad-hoc formats for easy parsing.

=== Temporal subsetting and valid time ranges

There are several ways to do temporal subsetting requests:

* Default: If no temporal subsetting is specified, the closest time to the current time is returned.
* All time range: A shorthand to request all the time range in a dataset is setting the parameter _time=all_. This can also be done by providing a
valid temporal range containing the entire dataset time range.
* One single time: Passing the parameter time will get the time slice closest to the requested time if it is within the time range of the dataset.
* Valid time range: A valid time range is defined with two of the three parameters: time_start, time_end and time_duration.

Times (time, time_start and time_end) must be specified as link:#W3Cdate[W3C date string] or "present" and time_duration as a link:#W3Cduration[W3C
time duration]

Examples of time query strings with valid temporal ranges:

* *time_start=2007-03-29T12:00:00Z&time_end=2007-03-29T13:00:00Z* (between 12 and 1 pm Greenwich time)
* *time_start=present&time_duration=P3D* (get 3 day forecast starting from the present)
* *time_end=present&time_duration=PT3H* (get last 3 hours)
* *time=2007-03-29T12:00:00Z*
* *time=present*
* *time=all*

=== Vertical coordinate subsetting

Subsetting on the vertical axis of a variable or variables with the same vertical levels may be done with the vertCoord parameter.

By default, all vertical levels are returned.

=== Single Variable requests

Note that these single variable requests can be easily extended to multi-variable request by simply passing a comma separated list of variables in the
var= parameter. Please note that for grid datasets, each variable in the request must have the same vertical levels.

Examples:
[width="100%",cols="60%,40%",options="header",]
|====
| Request |Query string
| _All of the data for the variable Temperature_pressure for the closest time to the current time_ | *?var=Temperature_pressure&temporal=all*
| _All of the data for the variable Temperature_pressure available in a given time range_ | *?var=Temperature_pressure&time_start=2015-08-19Z&time_end=2015-08-20T12:00:00Z*
| _All of the data for the variable Temperature_pressure for a specific time_ | *?var=Temperature_pressure&time=2015-09-06T00:00:00Z*
| _Subset the data for the variable Temperature_pressure over a given lat/lon bounding box for a specific time_ | *?var=Temperature_pressure&time=2015-09-06T00:00:00Z&north=41&west=-109.05&east=-102.05&south=37*
| _Temperature_pressure for every 5th point on the grid (deltax=deltay=5)_ | *?var=Temperature_pressure&horizStride=5*
| _Temperature_pressure for every 5th point on the grid over a given lat/lon bounding box_ |*?var=Temperature_pressure&north=41&west=-109.5&east=-102.5&south=37&horizStride=5*
| _Temperature_pressure at a particular vertical level: 1000 mb_ | *?var=Temperature_pressure&vertCoord=1000*
|====

* note that the vertical level value must be in the same units used in the dataset - in this example we assume millibars but you will need to check
the dataset description to be sure.
