= NetCDF Subset Service (NCSS) Reference

== Overview

The NetCDF Subset Service (NCSS) is a web service for subsetting <<../../netcdf-java/CDM/index#,CDM scientific datasets.>> The subsetting is
specified using earth coordinates, such as lat/lon or projection coordinates bounding boxes and date ranges, rather than index ranges that refer to
the underlying data arrays. The data arrays are subsetted but not resampled or reprojected, and preserve the resolution and accuracy of the original
dataset.

NCSS supports spatial and temporal subsetting on collections of grids, stations and points. A Dataset is described by a
*Dataset Description* XML document, which describes the dataset in enough detail to enable a programmatic client to form valid
data requests.

NCSS may return netCDF binary files (using {cf}[CF Conventions]),
XML, ASCII, or http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/waterml[WaterML2] depending on the request and the dataset.

NCSS uses HTTP GET with key-value pairs (KVP) which may appear in any order. The service interface follows
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer[REST design], as well as https://developers.google.com/kml/[Google/KML] and
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/[W3C XML Schema Datatypes] when applicable.

=== Dataset Descriptions

Each dataset has an XML document called the *_Dataset Description Document_*.
These are intended to perform the same function as OGC GetCapabilities or Atom Introspection, that is,
provide clients with the necessary information to formulate a valid request and send it to the server. *The
content of these documents is still evolving.*

Grid Dataset:

A Grid Dataset is a collection of Grids which have horizontal (x,y) coordinates, and optional vertical, time, and ensemble coordinates. Grid data points next to
each other in index space are next to each other in coordinate space.

* Example http://thredds.ucar.edu/thredds/ncss/grib/NCEP/DGEX/CONUS_12km/best/dataset.xml[*gridDataset*] document
(link:../files/gridsDataset.xml[offline] example)

Station Dataset::

Station datasets contain a collection of point features representing time-series of data points at named locations.

* Example http://thredds-test.unidata.ucar.edu/thredds/ncss/pointData/cf_doc_dsg/example/H.2.2.1.nc/dataset.xml[*Station Dataset*] document
(link:../files/stationsDataset.xml[offline] example)
* Station datasets also support http://thredds-test.unidata.ucar.edu/thredds/ncss/pointData/cf_doc_dsg/example/H.2.2.1.nc/station.xml[station list]
requests. This request will return all the stations within a specified bounding box. [NOTE: Broken as of 4.5.3. Will be fixed in 4.5.4.]

Point Dataset::

Point datasets contain a collection of point features which can be subset by space and time.

* Example http://thredds-test.unidata.ucar.edu/thredds/ncss/pointData/cf_doc_dsg/example/H.1.1.nc/dataset.xml[*Point Dataset*] document
(link:../files/pointDataset.xml[offline] example)Â 

== Subsetting Parameters for NCSS

* <<NcssGrid#,Grid datasets>>
* <<NcssPoint#,Point and Station (Discrete Sampling Geometry) datasets>>

Variable subsetting

* For all types, you *must* specify a list of valid variable names.

Horizontal spatial subsetting::

* stations: you may specify a lat/lon bounding box, a point location, or a list of stations. If none, do not filter.
* points: you may specify a lat/lon bounding box. If none, do not filter.
* Note the lat/lon bounding box declared in the dataset description is an approximated rectangle to the actual lat/lon boundaries so there may be
  valid points within the data but outside of the declared bounding box in the dataset description

Vertical spatial subsetting::

* variable with vertical levles will be returnd as profiles, unless a specific level is chosen.

Temporal subsetting::

* For all types, you may specify a time range or a specific time. If none, return the time closest to the present.
* A time range will request all features that intersect the range.
* A time point will request the feature that is closest to that time.
* If you include __temporal=all__, then return all times.

Output Format (__accept__ parameter)::

* __csv__: Comma-separated values, one feature per line
* __xml__: Collection of feature elements
* __netCDF__: CF/NetCDF-3
* __netCDF4__: CF/NetCDF-4 classic model
* __netCDF4ext__: NetCDF-4 extended model
* __WaterML2__: http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/waterml[OGC WaterML 2.0 Timeseries] (station only)

== Use cases

=== *Spatial and coordinate subsetting*

NCSS provides two types of bounding boxes to subset the data:

. *Lat/lon bounding box* is specified with the params _north, south, east_ and _west._ The _north_ and _south_ parameters are latitude values, and must
be in units of _degrees_north_ and lie between +/- 90. The _east_ and _west_ parameters are longitude values with units of __degrees_east__, and may
be positive or negative, and will be interpreted modulo 360. The requested subset starts at the west longitude and goes eastward until the east
longitude. Therefore, when crossing the dateline, the west edge may be greater than the east edge. For grids, if the underlying dataset is on a
projection, the minimum enclosing projection bounding box will be calculated and used. The data contained in the intersection of this rectangle with
the data is returned. To use, inspect _dataset.xml_ for the <LatLonBox> elements, which indicate the min and max extensions of the grid, for
example:
+
[source,xml]
------------------------
<LatLonBox>
  <west>-153.5889</west>
  <east>-48.5984</east>
  <south>11.7476</south>
  <north>57.4843</north>
</LatLonBox>
------------------------

Example request:

---------------------------------------------
&north=17.3&south=12.088&west=140.2&east=160.0
---------------------------------------------

. *Projection bounding box* (only on grid datasets with projections) is specified with the params _minx, miny, maxx_ and __maxy__. These are projection coordinates in
km on the projection plane; the data contained in the intersection of this rectangle with the data is returned. To use, inspect the dataset.xml for
the <projectionBox> elements, which indicate the min and max extensions of the grid, for example:
+
[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <gridSet name="time layer_between_two_pressure_difference_from_ground_layer y x">
    <projectionBox>
      <minx>-4264.248291015625</minx>
      <maxx>3293.955078125</maxx>
      <miny>-872.8428344726562</miny>
      <maxy>4409.772216796875</maxy>
    </projectionBox>
    ...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example request:

----
&minx=-500&miny=-1600&maxx=500&maxy=0
----

By default, if no spatial subsetting is specified, the service returns all the features in the dataset.


=== *Single-point requests*

The NetCDF Subset Service allows the user to extract data for a point of interest by specifying its latitude and longitude. The result differs
depending on the underlying dataset.

* If it's a grid dataset, that means we are using the grid-as-point service. NCSS will find the grid cell in which the lat/lon falls and return its
data as if it were a point feature. The supported output formats are _netCDF_, _netCDF4_, _XML_, and _CSV_.
* If it's a station dataset, NCSS will return data for the station nearest the specified lat/lon. The supported output formats are
_netCDF_, _netCDF4_, _XML_, _CSV_  and _WaterML2_.
* Point datasets do not support single-point requests.

For example:

--------------------------------------------------
?req=station&var=temp&latitude=40.2&longitude=61.8
--------------------------------------------------

This finds the station nearest to (lat=40.2, lon=61.8) and returns its temperature data.

=== *Temporal subsetting and valid time ranges*

There are several ways to do temporal subsetting requests:

* Default: If no temporal subseting is specified, the closest time to the current time is returned.
* All time range: A shorthand to request all the time range in a dataset is setting the parameter _time=all_. This can also be done by providing a
valid temporal range containing the entire dataset time range.
* One single time: Passing the parameter time will get the time slice closest to the requested time if it is within the time range of the dataset.
* Valid time range: A valid time range is defined with two of the three parameters: time_start, time_end and time_duration.

Times (time, time_start and time_end) must be specified as <<{gloss}#W3C_Date,W3C Date>> or "present" and time_duration as a <<{gloss}#W3C_Duration,W3C time duration>>

Examples of time query strings with valid temporal ranges:

* *time_start=2007-03-29T12:00:00Z&time_end=2007-03-29T13:00:00Z* (between 12 and 1 pm Greenwich time)
* *time_start=present&time_duration=P3D* (get 3 day forecast starting from the present)
* *time_end=present&time_duration=PT3H* (get last 3 hours)
* *time=2007-03-29T12:00:00Z*
* *time=present*
* *time=all*

=== *Vertical coordinate subsetting*


Subsetting on the vertical axis of a variable or variables with the same vertical levels may be done with the vertCoord parameter.

By default, all vertical levels are returned.

=== *Single Variable requests*

Note that these single variable requests can be easily extended to multivariable request by simply passing a comma separated list of variables in the
var= parameter. Please note that for grid datasets, each variable in the request must have the same vertical levels.

Examples:
[width="100%",cols="60%,40%",options="header",]
|====
| Request |Query string
| _All of the data for the variable Temperature_pressure for the closest time to the current time_ | *?var=Temperature_pressure&temporal=all*
| _All of the data for the variable Temperature_pressure available in a given time range_ | *?var=Temperature_pressure&time_start=2015-08-19Z&time_end=2015-08-20T12:00:00Z*
| _All of the data for the variable Temperature_pressure for a specific time_ | *?var=Temperature_pressure&time=2015-09-06T00:00:00Z*
| _Subset the data for the variable Temperature_pressure over a given lat/lon bounding box for a specific time_ | *?var=Temperature_pressure&time=2015-09-06T00:00:00Z&north=41&west=-109.05&east=-102.05&south=37*
| _Temperature_pressure for every 5th point on the grid (deltax=deltay=5)_ | *?var=Temperature_pressure&horizStride=5*
| _Temperature_pressure for every 5th point on the grid over a given lat/lon bounding box_ |*?var=Temperature_pressure&north=41&west=-109.5&east=-102.5&south=37&horizStride=5*
| _Temperature_pressure at a particular vertical level: 1000 mb_ | *?var=Temperature_pressure&vertCoord=1000*
| _Air_temperature for stations named LECO, LEST and LEVX_ | *?var=air_temperature&subset=stns&stns=LECO,LEST,LEVX*
|====

* note that the vertical level value must be in the same units used in the dataset - in this example we assume millibars but you will need to check
the dataset description to be sure.
