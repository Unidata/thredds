<p><strong>Q: <a name="strange"></a>I have a strange problem and I need help figuring out whats going on!</strong></p>

<p>A: Here is what we need from you in order to deal with hard problems:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Run the latest stable release. Sorry, we don't have the resources to keep older versions running, so we need to deal with just the latest code.</li>
  <li>Get a clean set of logs that capture the problem:
    <ol>
      <li>Stop the tomcat server.</li>
      <li>Install the latest release if needed.</li>
      <li>Remove all files from <em>{tomcat}/logs </em>and<em> {tomcat}/content/thredds/logs</em></li>
      <li>Restart the server</li>
      <li>Make the problem happen</li>
      <li>Zip up everything in <em>{tomcat}/logs</em> and <em>{tomcat}/content/thredds/logs</em>.</li>
      <li>Send the logs and a detailed description of what you do to make the problem happen, and what the problem looks like. If it took a while to get the
        problem to happen, note what time it happened so that we can correlate with the logs.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q: I made changes to my catalog and restarted<a name="restart"></a> tomcat but nothing changes.</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>look in<strong> catalina.out </strong>for a message that tomcat did not shut down:<br>
    <pre>java.net.BindException: Address already in use:8080 </pre>
  </li>
  <li>make sure tomcat really gets stopped:
    <ol>
      <li><em>ps -ef | grep java </em>to find the process id</li>
      <li><em>kill &lt;pid&gt; </em>or<em> kill -9 &lt;pid&gt;</em></li>
      <li><em>ps -ef | grep java</em> to verify that the process goes away.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Restart tomcat:
    <ol>
      <li><em>sh ./startup.sh
      </em></li>
      <li>Check <strong>catalina.out</strong> that tomcat started correctly</li>
      <li><em>ps -ef | grep java</em> to verify that theer is a new tomcat process.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q: <a name="repository"></a>I'm building my own maven project and want to use your jar files. Where is the Unidata Repository?</strong></p>

<p>A: In order to configure your maven project correctly, you need to edit your pom.xml file to reflect the location of Unidata's repository. To do this, you
  need to add the following pom snippet to your pom.xml file:</p>

<pre>
&lt;repositories&gt;
    &lt;repository&gt;
        &lt;id&gt;unidata-releases&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;name>UNIDATA Releases&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;url&gt;https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/repository/unidata-releases/&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;/repository&gt;
&lt;/repositories&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  Alternatively, you can configure your settings.xml file to reflect the repository location. Information on doing either is located here:

<p>

    <a href="http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Repositories">Maven Repository information</a>

<p>

  and here:

<p>

    <a href="http://maven.apache.org/settings.html">Maven Settings information</a>

<p>

<p><strong>Q: <a name="citation"></a>I'm submitting a paper for publication and want to include a citation for the TDS. What reference should I use?</strong></p>

<p>A. The following can be used as a citation:

</p>

<pre>
Unidata, (year): THREDDS Data Server (TDS) version tds_version [software].
Boulder, CO: UCAR/Unidata. (<a href="http://doi.org/10.5065/D6N014KG">http://doi.org/10.5065/D6N014KG</a>)
</pre>

<p>where year is the year in which the work being described was done and tds_version is the version of the TDS used. For example:

</p>

<pre>
Unidata, (2015): THREDDS Data Server (TDS) version 4.6.2 [software].
Boulder, CO: UCAR/Unidata. (<a href="http://doi.org/10.5065/D6N014KG">http://doi.org/10.5065/D6N014KG</a>)
</pre>

<p>
<hr width="100%">

<h2>Catalogs</h2>

<p><strong>Q:<a name="CatalogURLs"></a> How do I construct the URLs I find in a THREDDS Catalog? </strong><br>
</p>

<p>A: Heres the general idea in the <a href="tutorial/CatalogPrimer.html#Constructing_an_access_URL">tutorial</a> and the
  <a href="catalog/InvCatalogSpec.html#constructingURLs">catalog spec</a> docs. If you are using the CDM
  library, you can call </p>
<pre>InvAccess.getUrlPath()</pre>

<hr width="50%" align="left">

<p><strong><a name="extraDataset"></a>Q: How do I eliminate the extra dataset when using a Catalog Reference?</strong></p>

<p>Make the name of the catalogRef the same as the &quot;top&quot; dataset in the referenced catalog. In the following example the name is &quot;&quot;<strong>New
  Point Data</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>In the referencing catalog:</p>
<pre> &lt;catalogRef xlink:href=&quot;idd/newPointObs.xml&quot; xlink:title=&quot;<strong>New Point Data</strong>&quot; name=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
<p>In the referenced catalog:</p>
<pre>&lt;catalog xmlns=&quot;http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/thredds/InvCatalog/v1.0&quot; 
 xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot; name=&quot;THREDDS-IDD OPeNDAP Data Server - New Station Data&quot;
 version=&quot;1.0.3&quot;&gt;

  &lt;service name=&quot;ncdods&quot; serviceType=&quot;OPENDAP&quot; base=&quot;/thredds/dodsC/&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;dataset name=&quot;<strong>New Point Data</strong>&quot;&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/dataset&gt;
&lt;/catalog&gt;</pre>

<hr width="100%">

<p><strong><a name="externalService"></a>Q: How do I provide an external service, one that is not provided by the TDS?</strong></p>
<p>Make up your own service element, with an absolute URL for its base, in the configuration catalog. For example, suppose you want to use the THREDDS OPeNDAP server, and an external  WMS server:</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;  
&lt;catalog xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/thredds/InvCatalog/v1.0" &gt;
  &lt;service name=&quot;both&quot; serviceType=&quot;compound&quot; base=&quot;&quot;&gt;
   &lt;service name=&quot;ncdods&quot; serviceType=&quot;OPENDAP&quot; base=&quot;/thredds/dodsC/&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;service name="extWMS" serviceType="WMS" base="http://myserver:8080/wms" /&gt;
  &lt;/service&gt;

  &lt;dataset name="SAGE III Ozone 2006-10-31" serviceName="both" urlPath="sage/20061031.nc" ID="20061031.nc"/&gt;
&lt;/catalog&gt;
</pre>
<p>The problem is communicating the correct URL to your external WMS server.</p>

<h4><a name="throttleRequests"></a>Q: How do I keep client requests from overwhelming my server?</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is currently no per-client resource throttle, unfortunately, but we are aware
    of the need for that. Any given request is single-threaded, so can't hog too
    many resources. One can limit the size of opendap responses, which tends to be the
    main problem on some servers. See the
    <a href="./reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile.html#opendap">OPeNDAP section</a>
    of the threddsConfig.xml page for details. </p>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%" align="left">

<h4><a name="tooManyFilesOpen"></a>
  Q: Can aggregations of many files cause "too many files open" problems?</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Union type agregations will open all the files in the aggregation at once. The other types (joinNew, joinExisting)  only open one file at a time, and then close it, so these can't cause
    "too many file" problems.</p>

  <p>If you have "too many open files" errors and you are not using large Union aggregations, then either theres a file leak (which we
    would like to know about), or you have your file cache limit set too high relative
    to your OS file handle limit.</p>
  <p>To debug file leaks:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Check number of open files with &quot;ulimit -a&quot;.</li>
    <li>Restart Tomcat to close open files.</li>
    <li>Monitor open files with &quot;/usr/proc/bin/pfiles [Tomcat Process ID]&quot;</li>
    <li>Recreate the problem with minimal number of steps so we can reproduce, then send pfiles output to support.</li>
  </ol>

<h4>Q: <a name="nonHttpStatusCodes">What do the non-HTTP status codes in the <code>threddsServlet.log</code> files mean?</a></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p> The "Request Completed" messages in the <code>threddsServlet.log</code> files contain
    several fields including a status code.
    the HTTP status code returned in a completed response. If a request is forwarded to
    another internal service, a "1000 (Forwarded)" or "1001 ( </p>

<h4>Q: <a name="inconsistentArrayLength">I'm seeing the error "Inconsistent array length read: 538976288 != 1668244581' when I open the dataset in the IDV.
  Why?</a></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>The error "Inconsistent array length read" only tells you that there was an error on
    the server in the middle of responding to an OPeNDAP request. You then must look in
    the <strong>threddsServlet.log</strong> and find the error to know why. </p>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%" align="left">

<h4><a name="javaUtilPrefs"></a>Q: Why am I getting lots of
  <code>java.util.prefs.BackingStoreException</code> warning messages?</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you allow and use the TDS WMS service, you may be seeing warning messages in your
    Tomcat <code>catalina.out</code> log file that look something like this:</p>
<pre>
May 25, 2010 6:28:22 PM java.util.prefs.FileSystemPreferences syncWorld
WARNING: Couldn't flush system prefs: java.util.prefs.BackingStoreException: /etc/.java/.systemPrefs/org create failed.
</pre>

  <p>You can get rid of these messages by setting the "java.util.prefs.systemRoot"
    system property to a location that is writable by the user that Tomcat runs under. </p>

  <p>Here is what we do on our servers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a directory at <code>${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/javaUtilPrefs/.systemPrefs</code>, e.g.,
<pre>
cd ${tomcat_home}/content/thredds
mkdir javaUtilPrefs
mkdir javaUtilPrefs/.systemPrefs

mkdir javaUtilPrefs/.userPrefs
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Make sure that the<code>.systemPrefs</code> and <code>.userPrefs</code> directories are writable by the user under which
      Tomcat runs
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the following to <code>JAVA_OPTS</code>
      in the <code>${tomcat_home}/bin/setenv.sh</code> file:
      <pre>-Djava.util.prefs.systemRoot=$CATALINA_HOME/content/thredds/javaUtilPrefs -Djava.util.prefs.userRoot=$CATALINA_HOME/content/thredds/javaUtilPrefs</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4><a name="proxyServerAndGeneratedURLs">Q: My TDS server is behind a proxy server.
  Why do some TDS generated URLs point to my TDS server instead of my proxy server?</a></h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most TDS generated URLs are relative to the server (e.g., "/thredds/dodsC/") or relative to
    the the current document's base URL. There are only a few places where it is necessary to
    generate absolute URLs. In those cases, the TDS uses information from the incoming HTTP request
    to construct the generated URLs. It is up to the proxy to send the correct information to the
    proxied server so the request information will be correct.</p>

  <p>For more information, see our <a href="reference/TomcatBehindProxyServer.html">web page on
    running Tomcat behind a proxy server</a>. It contains links to Tomcat documentation
    on both mod_proxy and mod_jk as well as some user contributed documentation on setting up
    mod_proxy.</p>

<hr width="50%" align="left">
<h4><a name="JoinExisting"></a>Q: I have modified my configuration of a JoinExisting Aggregation dataset, but nothing has changed.</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>The files and coordinates in a JoinExisting Aggregations are cached, and in some circumstances
    won't get updated. The default location for the cache is <strong>${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/cache/agg/</strong>
    unless you change it in the <a href="reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile.html#AggregationCache">threddsConfig.xml</a>
    file. Go to that directory, there will be files with the name of the cached dataset(s). Delete
    the file for the dataset that needs updating and restart Tomcat. </p>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%" align="left">
<h4><a name="wmsLimitedCRS"></a>Q: What happened to the long list of CRSs in my WMS GetCapabilities documents?</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>In TDS 4.1, each WMS GetCapabilities document listed 100s of available CRS. This made for very
    large GetCapabilities documents. As of TDS 4.2, this list is limited to a select few CRSs. We
    hope to make this list configurable in a future release. </p>

  <p>In the mean time if you need a CRS that isn't listed, try specifying it in the GetMap request.
    The underlying library that handles CRS (<a href="http://www.geotoolkit.org/">Geotoolkit</a>)
    still supports a large number of CRS and the TDS WMS should still support any of those CRS
    when requested. </p>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%" align="left">

<p><strong>Q: <a name="forms"></a>Why are TDS web forms not working?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Look in {$TOMCAT}/logs/localhost.logs for error messages like:</p>
  <pre>     SEVERE: Servlet.service() for servlet GridSubsetService threw exception
   javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactoryConfigurationError: Provider net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl not found</pre>
  <p>If you find these, the likely problem is that another webapp running in the same Tomcat container has set the XSLT parser with
    javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory, which is global for the JVM. The above example shows that the Saxon parser has been set, but is not being found by
    the TDS. We saw this happening with the OOSTethys webapp. </p>

  <p>The solution is to move the other webapp to its own Tomcat instance, or to move the required jar (eg saxon.jar) into Tomcat's lib directory, where it is
    available to all webapps. TDS does very simple XSLT to create its web forms, so its likely that it can work with any decent XSLT library. By default it uses
    the JDK's built-in XSLT library.</p>

<hr width="50%" align="left">

<p><a name="catalogCaching" id="catalogCaching"></a><strong>Q: What does the TDS do at startup to
  read the configuration catalogs? What gets cached? Does it have a way to know a referenced
  catalog is unchanged? When do referenced catalogs get scanned?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> The TDS reads in all the config catalogs at startup. It caches all of them, and uses the "expires" attribute on the catalog to decide if/when it needs to
    re-read a catalog.  It must read all catalogs, including catalogRefs, because it has to know what the possible dataset URLs are, and there is no
    contract that a client has to read a catalog before accessing the dataset. </p>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%" align="left">

<p><strong><a name="changeLogging">Q: How do I change how the TDS logs?</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the TDS is deployed for the first time, the contents of thredds.war will be &quot;exploded&quot; (i.e. extracted) to <code>$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/thredds</code>. To change how the TDS logs, you'll need to modify <code>$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/thredds/WEB-INF/classes/log4j2.xml</code>, which is a <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html">Log4j 2 configuration file</a>.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that instead of overwriting server startup messages in <code>$CONTENT_ROOT/thredds/logs/serverStartup.log</code> from a previous run with new ones (the default behavior), you want to create a new log file for each startup. In that case, you'd change:</p>

<pre>&lt;File name=&quot;serverStartupAppender&quot; fileName=&quot;${tds.log.dir}/serverStartup.log&quot; append=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
    &lt;PatternLayout pattern=&quot;%d{yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ} [%10r][%8X{ID}] %-5p %c: %m%n&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/File&gt;</pre>

<p>to something like:</p>

<pre>&lt;RollingFile name=&quot;serverStartupAppender&quot; fileName=&quot;${tds.log.dir}/serverStartup.log&quot;<br>      filePattern=&quot;${tds.log.dir}/serverStartup.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}_%i.log&quot;&gt;<br>  &lt;PatternLayout pattern=&quot;%d{yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ} [%10r][%8X{ID}] %-5p %c: %m%n&quot;/&gt;<br>  &lt;Policies&gt;<br>    &lt;OnStartupTriggeringPolicy /&gt;<br>  &lt;/Policies&gt;<br>&lt;/RollingFile&gt;
</pre>
<p>Be aware that if you install a new thredds.war to <code>$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps</code>, the exploded directory&mdash;including all changes you made to <code>log4j2.xml</code>&mdash;will be removed and the webapp will be redeployed from the new thredds.war. We suggest you copy <code>log4j2.xml</code> to a different location for the deployment and then copy it back over afterwards.</p>

<h2>Caching</h2>

<p><strong>Q: We use <a name="compressed"></a> compressed netcdf files and the very first access to them are quite slow, although subsequent accesses are much
  faster, then become slow again after a while. I can see that TDS uncompress these files to the cdm cache directory, but then they must get deleted. Is there a
  way to keep them in the cache permanently? </strong><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Esentially this is a tradeoff between storage space and the time to decompress. I assume you dont want to store the files uncompressed, so you have to pay
    the price of that. To control how these files are cached, see <a href="reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile.html#DiskCache">CDM library Disk cache</a>. I would
    suggest that you use:<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<pre> &lt;<strong>DiskCache</strong>&gt;<br>    &lt;<strong>alwaysUse</strong>&gt;true&lt;/alwaysUse&gt;<br>    &lt;<strong>scour</strong>&gt;1 hour&lt;/scour&gt;<br>    &lt;<strong>maxSize</strong>&gt;10 Gb&lt;/maxSize&gt;<br>  &lt;/DiskCache&gt;</pre>
<blockquote>
  <p> and choose <strong>maxSize</strong> carefully.
    The trick is to make <strong>maxSize</strong> big enough to keep the "working set" uncompressed, i.e. if there is a reletively small "hot" set of files that
    get accessed a lot, you want to give enough cache space to keep them uncompressed in the cache. Monitor the cache directory closely to see what files stay
  uncompressed, and how old they are, and modify <strong>maxSize</strong> as needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: Since I upgraded, my joinExisting aggregation is now very slow. It used to be fast!</strong> <a name="joinExistingCache"></a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>JoinExisting</strong> aggregations need to open each file and extract the coordinates the first time the aggregation is accessed. The information is cached (by default) in <em>content/thredds/cache/agg, </em>so subsequent reads will be much faster.</p>
  <p>A change to the default behavior of DiskCache2 may cause a need to re-read the files. The 4.3 default was to put all cache files into a single directory, but 4.6 default makes nested directories, because having thousands of files in a single directory is Considered Harmful. If you need to, you can control that behavior in threddsConfig.xml, but better is to pay the price and redo the cache with nested directories. </p>
<p>Note that to get everything in the joinExisting cache ahead of time, you just need to make a request for the aggregation coordinate (usually time) values. You could do it with an OPeNDAP request, or just open the file as a Grid (eg WMS, WCS, NCSS, from ToolsUI, IDV, etc) which will automatically request all coordinates. A script to do so is also easy enough, using wget or python or whatever you like.
<p>
  Upgrading to a new version is a good time to clear out your caches, if you are installing on top of your old TDS. Just go to your cache directory (default is<em> content/thredds/cache</em>), and delete the entire directory, or if you have the inclination, go and selectively delete old stuff (but then you have to think harder). Then trigger a repopulation as above.<br>

<h2>TDS Install Errors</h2>

<p><a name="rh5SymLinksAndContent" id="rh5SymLinksAndContent"></a><strong>
  Q: Why does the TDS fail to deploy in the Tomcat provided by RedHat 5 or 6?</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Tomcat installation provided with RedHat 5 and 6 (and with yum) is run from <code>/usr/share/tomcat5</code>
    which contains symbolic links that point into <code>/var/lib/tomcat5</code>. The permissions
    are such that the TDS cannot write the content/thredds directory in the standard location,
    <code>${tomcat_home}/content/thredds</code> (in this case
    <code>/usr/share/tomcat5/content/thredds</code>). The error message in
    <code>catalina.out</code> looks something like this:
  </p>
  <pre>

  <p>And there should be a message in the <code>localhost.*.log</code> file that looks something
    like this:
  </p>
  <pre>ERROR - TdsContext.init(): Content directory does not exist and could not be created [/usr/share/tomcat5/content]</pre>
  <p>There are currently two solutions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create the needed directories by hand and setup appropriate symlinks
      <ul>
        <li>create the TDS <code>content</code> directory in <code>/var/lib/tomcat5</code>;
        </li>
        <li>make sure the tomcat user owns the <code>content</code> directory and has read/write permission; and</li>
        <li>create the symlink <code>/usr/share/tomcat5/content</code> that points to the directory created above.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Give the TDS an absolute path to the desired location for the <code>content</code> directory by setting the
      <strong>tds.content.root.path</strong> system property with a command-line argument (e.g.,
      "<code>-Dtds.content.root.path=/some/absolute/path</code>"). More information is available

    <p>You are using the Tomcat Manager, which limits the size of the thredds.war file that can be uploaded. You can install the war file directly into the tomcat webapps directory, or you can change the manager configuration:</p>

change  &lt;max-file-size&gt; and  &lt;max-request-size&gt; to be larger than xxx.

<h4>Q: <a name="OutOfMemoryError" id="OutOfMemoryError">Im getting the error "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space". Whats up?</a></h4>

  <p>If you reload the <strong>thredds.war</strong> webapp enough times without restarting Tomcat, you will eventually run into "<strong>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</strong>". This is a known bug in JDK/Tomcat. The only thing to do is to stop and restart Tomcat. </p>
  <p>The other possibility is that you havent given the TDS enough heap space. The default heap size is quite small, so you need to always set this, eg in <a href="reference/ChecklistReference.html">setenv.sh</a>, this sets the heap to 4 GB.</p>

<h4>Q: <a name="permGenOutOfMemoryError">Im getting the error "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space". Whats up?</a></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>The good news is that this problem goes away with Java 8, and we recommend that you switch to Java 8 NOW.</p>
  <p>Before Java 8, if you reload the <strong>thredds.war</strong> webapp enough times without restarting Tomcat, you
    will eventually run into "<strong>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError:
    PermGen space</strong>". This is a known bug in JDK/Tomcat. The only thing to do is to stop and restart Tomcat. </p>

  <p>You  can  increase PermGen using this JVM option, eg in <a href="reference/ChecklistReference.html">setenv.sh</a>:</p>

  <pre>MAX_PERM_GEN="-XX:MaxPermSize=256m"</pre>

  <p>In Java 6 and 7, the default is 64m. However, with
    enough redeploys , you will eventually run out of PermGen space no
    matter what your <strong>MaxPermSize</strong> setting is. We have
    gotten into the habit of restarting Tomcat on our production server
    whenever we redeploy. Lots of redeploys only happen on our test server.</p>

<h4>Q: <a name="shutdownUnstoppedThreads">During shutdown I'm getting messages about threads (ThreadLocal) having to be shut down to prevent memory leaks. Whats

  <p>Tomcat memory leak detection code started logging these messages as of Tomcat 6.0.24. From

<h4>Q: <a name="preventAccess">How can I prevent someone from accessing my server?</a></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>If your server is being overwhelmed by requests from a particular user/computer, it is best to exclude
    them using their IP address rather than their hostname (this avoids having to perform a DNS lookup for
    each request). To do so, edit the <strong>${tomcat_home}/conf/server.xml</strong> file and find the
    "localhost" <strong>Host</strong> element. Add a RemoteAddrValve <strong>Valve</strong> element as
    follows: </p>

  <blockquote>
  <pre>
&lt;Host name=&quot;localhost&quot; debug=&quot;0&quot; appBase=&quot;webapps&quot; .. &gt;
  <strong>&lt;Valve className=&quot;org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve&quot; deny=&quot;18\.83\.0\.150&quot; /&gt;</strong>
  ...
&lt;/Host&gt;
  </pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The value of the deny attribute must be one or more (comma delimited) regular expressions each of which will
    be compared to the remote clients IP addresses. For instance:</p>

  <blockquote>
  <pre>
deny="18\.83\.0\.150,128\.100\.34\.99,128\.117\.140\..*"
  </pre>
