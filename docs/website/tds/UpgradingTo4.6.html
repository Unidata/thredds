<hr>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Java 7 is  required</li>
  <li>Tomcat version 7.0.43 or greater</li>
</ul>
<h2>GRIB Feature Collection Changes</h2>
<ol>
  <li>GRIB Collections now scale to large numbers of files.</li>
  <li>New indexes (.<strong>ncx3</strong>) will be written the first time GRIB files are accessed. You may delete the older indices (<strong>ncx</strong>, <strong>ncx2</strong>) if you like. The <strong>gbx9</strong> indices can stay as they are somewhat expensive to build (requiring a sequential read of the GRIBfiles). Deleting them will allow a few minor improvements to be made when recreating.</li>
  <li>GRIB Best Collections now show the runtime as an auxiliary coordinate, and runtimes are monotonic increasing.</li>
  <li>Some GRIB specific <a href="reference/collections/GribCollectionFaq.html">FAQs</a></li>
  <li>For complete information, see <a href="reference/collections/GribCollections.html">GRIB Collections</a> and <a href="reference/collections/TDM.html">TDM</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>API changes</h2>
<h3>Client Catalog API</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The catalog processing classes in <strong>thredds.catalog</strong> package has been replaced by <strong>thredds.client.catalog</strong> everywhere in  client code. If you are using  <strong>thredds.catalog</strong>  in your code, please switch to <strong>thredds.catalog</strong>.<strong>client</strong>, as it is takes less memory and is better performant. The old classes are deprecated but still available, but in future versions they will be moved to <strong>legacy.jar</strong>, which you will need to seperately include in your classpath if needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Internal changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We are now using <strong>gradle</strong> to do our builds. Maven will continue to be supported for now (version 4.6.0).</li>
  <li>Using <strong>Coverity</strong> to find and fix more than 4000 defects. Defect count now &lt; 1 / 1000 LOC.</li>
</ul>
