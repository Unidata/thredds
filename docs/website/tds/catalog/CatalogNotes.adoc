= Catalog Notes

== Notes for follow-on to 1.0

* Add datasetRef element that references a dataset element in an
external catalog. Similar to catalogRef but uses XPath (just ID part of
XPath?) to reference a dataset element in the catalog, e.g.,
http://server/catalog.xml#myFavDataset. +
* Make the vocabulary_name and units attributes of the variable element
children of the variable element and allow the vocabulary attribute on
both new elements. Possibly override/inherit the vocabulary attribute in
the variables element. Could also allow multiple vocabulary_name
elements so that dataset variable could be mapped to multiple controlled
vocabularies in one place. This was discussed on the thredds email list
around 1 October 2004 (Subject: v1.0 and
vocabularies):http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/support/help/MailArchives/thredds/msg00336.html +
* Think about adding a type to catalogRef so that we can point to other
types of catalogs (from JeffMc)
* Add expire and other cacheing type info for datasets as well as
catalogs +
* Rethink how the date/range and dateEnumTypes in the XSD are
defined/allowed. Some of the types are appropriate for dates and others
for date ranges.

== For 0.7

* Rethink the <catalog><dataset/></catalog> structure and it’s
interaction with catalogRef elements. Spec says "**The dataset chooser
software should seamlessly present a catalogRef to the user, for example
by eliminating the referenced catalog’s top-level dataset in its
presentation of the catalog when its name matches the title of the
catalogRef title attribute.**" But the TDV seems to always remove the
top-level dataset even if names don’t match (but changes from the
``catalogRef.xlink:title'' to the ``dataset.name''). What are we really
trying to model with these structures?
* Rethink service type model. Look more at ADEPT access model.
* EMSL seems like it fits as both a metadata record and as a dataset
service type. I don’t understand this fully but isn’t an EMSL client
able to access the referenced dataset if it has the EMSL file?
* Rethink data type model.
* How indicate to a metadata harvesting tool (say OAI server) that a
particular metadata record should be harvested by a particular digital
library. Also may need to know that DLs ID for that metadata record.
* Resolver service (DQC server?): need serviceType=``Resolver''.
* Figure out how to deal with DTD/Schemas for InvCatalog and for
multiple metadata types at same time.
* [Actually for Java API] rethink implementation and how API exposes
impl in terms of going both from the XML to an object model as well as
from an object model to XML.

== Simplify service/access model?

Does this relate to the whole service typing issue? Probably since it
would be nice to know what info is needed at the service level and at
the dataset(access) level before figuring out how to encode it.

What we want to support:

1.  Many datasets reference one service/access.
* Done in 0.6: Use serviceName to reference a service element and append
urlPath to services base URL. The value of serviceName comes from
closest self/ancestor that has a serviceName.
* For 0.7: ???
2.  One or more datasets have the same set of services where the ending
of the URL is the same for each service.
* Done in 0.6: Reference a service of type ``Compound'' (but urlPath has
to be the same for all sub-services)
* For 0.7: ???
3.  A dataset has multiple service/access methods but the URLs end with
different strings
* Done in 0.6: Each child access element represents a service/access for
the parent dataset. An access element can reference an existing service
element or can provide a fully qualified URL and a serviceType.
* For 0.7: ???
4.  A dataset has a set of services/accesses that no other dataset in
the catalog has. (contain set of access elements)
* Done in 0.6: Either create and reference a compound service or contain
a set of child access elements.
* For 0.7: ???
5.  Other cases?
* Done in 0.6: ???
* For 0.7: ???

Can we develop a simpler model for 0.7 that keeps the simple/common
things simple but allows for more complex cases?

Information represented by 0.6 service/access:

* Service type (@serviceType from service or access)
* Base URL (@base from service [ unless access gives absolute URL])
* String to add to base URL (@urlPath from dataset or access)
* Suffix to be appended to base URL ?before or after the urlPath?
(@suffix from service)
* Which service/access a dataset uses
** dataset references a service with @serviceName (use value of
@serviceName from the closest self/ancestor dataset that has a
@serviceName
** access element references a service with @serviceName

How about for 0.7 we have services and compound services but a dataset
has an access method only when it contains an access element?

=== *Benno’s suggestions*

http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/doc/dochelp/topics/MIRROR/suggestions.html

=== Dataset names

__Benno__: Allow specification of both a name and a long_name. Most of
the THREDDS catalogs being generated are ill-suited to language-based
clients. I of course have rewritten my code to handle the awkward names,
but it seems pretty silly seeing as all the data providers have
site-unique short names in the first place.For a language-based client,
there is more to it than that. There is the long_name that gets
displayed on output, the short name that is used to refer to that
dataset in expressions and commands or as part of a much longer name
that includes the names at higher levels of the tree, (e.g. sst is fully
referend to as IRIDL SOURCES AC smoothed sst while its long_name is sea
surface temperature), and the URL is used by the software to access the
data.

=== Coherency

__Jeff__: For example, say Raj is putting together a catalog that holds
data for labs in a met. class.One of the entries is a set of 5 radar
images. Each of those images is a url but Raj wants to define the set of
5 as a cohesive set. He does not want the students to see all 5 time
urls in the catalog chooser, rather he just wants to see a link.

__John__: In a catalog, we started off having ``collections'', but the
distinction betweeen collection and dataset was blurry, so we decided to
just call everything a dataset. A dataset can have a URL, can have
nested datasets, or both. The idea is that it would have its own URL if
it was ``cohesive'', but that requires support on the data server.

One assumes that datasets are collected together for some good reason,
but its not known what that reason is. So what exactly would
``CompositeDataset'' mean? I would be more inclinde to be more specific,
like ``CompositeDataset_TimeSeries'' etc.

Given such a collection, can a client figure out what to do with it? The
DODS Aggregation Server (AS) faced a similar question. Your use case
probably corresponds to this AS use case:

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_The JoinNew aggregation type ``joins'' variables along a new dimension.
The dimension and a coordinate variable is created and values for the
coordinates are specified in the aggregation element._
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The other AS use cases are ``Union'' and ``JoinExisting''. The main
issue of JoinNew is to identify the coordinate variables of the new
dimensions, ie how do you know what the time value is for each URL? The
AS just makes the server configurer explicitly specify them; one could
do more elegent things, esp if you can rely on identifying a time coord
variable. That is however, ``service protocol specific'' from the
catalog POV.

So a CompositeDataset_TimeSeries tag could be all that a smart client
needs to do the right thing, and it is certainly a common case. We could
possibly add a tag to identify the time coordinate or the variable with
the time coordinate in it. It may not be possible to be more precise
about what the right thing is, except in a data model / protocol
dependent way.

What other kinds of coherency might there be?

__Ethan__: Jeff and I were just talking about this in the hallway. The
similarity between a cohesive dataset collection and the agg types came
to mind for me as well. A few +
 use cases that come to mind:

* CompositeDataset_TimeSeries (or _Series, where the series can be along
non-time axes): a series of items (e.g., points, grids, images)
monotonic on some axes. Example: latest 5 radar images from single
station
* CompositeDataset_Station (or _Point, where the points could be on 1D,
2D, 3D,…): a set of point items in some space Example: all profiler
stations at one time
* CompositeDataset_Field: a set of fields that occupy same space
Example: Rolands single parameter datasets all on same grid

To me the Agg ``Union'', ``JoinNew'', and ``JoinExisting'' describe the
syntax of how to make things cohesive where the ``CompositeDataset_*''
types are the semantics of what the cohesive whole means.

Perhaps too soon to think much about how to encode this in a THREDDS
catalog but my initial thought is to encode it as a kind of proxy
service/access. The service type could be ``CompositeDataset_*'' with
the ``Union|Join*'' info in a property element or something but no URL
information.

 

== Other

* **XML character encoding**. Benno is using &ecirc; and &eacute; What
is the right way to handle this?
** use the predefined ``entity references'' for the following chars:
+
___________
&lt; < +
 &gt; > +
 &quot; " +
 &apos; ’ +
 &amp; &
___________
** use the
http://www.trcc.commnet.edu/Prog_Study/Eng_Tech/Comp_Sci_Tech/Merrick/Character-Level%20Codes.htm[numeric
code] for other special chars
* **DataType optional**, what should TDV do? Benno not using.
* *Client handling of multiple services for the same dataset.* Do you
present a choice to the user? Then you need a way to distinguish the
choices to present to the user. Do we just use the ServiceType, or
should we add a human-readable name to the service for display  to the
user? How does DODS deal with this vis-a-vis translator services?
* *Clients are not able to deal with all ServiceTypes.* We should
provide the functionality that a client specifies what ServiceTypes it
can handle, and the choice selector should eliminate the ones that it
cannot. Looking ahead to a Catalog Server, this evolves into a filtering
operation on ServiceType.

'''''

== URL Construction

Catalogs have to unambiguously specify a dataset. This means that there
must be enough info and a set of clear rules on how to access the
dataset. These will be specific to each service-protocol.

**DODS**: construct the dataset URL

 __url = serverBase + datasetPath + (``.dds'' | ``.das'')__

But if you want to use a constraint expression (CE), you need a more
sophisticated rule:

* 1) _url = serverBase + datasetPath_
* _2) if ``?'' exists, then insert (``.dds'' | ``.das'') just before the
``?'' else append it_

Proposal: add a ``suffix'' attribute to the service element: _url =
serverBase + datasetPath + serverSuffix + (``.dds>'' | ``.das'')_

*ADDE__:__* construct the dataset URL

*  __url = serverBase +  ``/imagedata?'' + datasetPath__
* optionally use ``accessPath'' info from the datasetDesc:  _url =
serverBase + ``/imagedata?'' + datasetPath + accessPath1 + accessPath2 +
…_

*NetCDF: __* construct the dataset URL, no mods are needed

*  __url = serverBase + datasetPath__

*Others TBD*
