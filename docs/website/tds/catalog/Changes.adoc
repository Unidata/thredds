= Changes to Client Catalog schema +

== Changes for version 1.0.7

* bring DataFormatTypes and ServiceTypes enumerations up to date with
the code

== Changes for version 1.0.2

Changes to enumerated types:

* ``serviceType'' enumerations: deprecated ``NetcdfServer''; added
``NetcdfSubset''.
* ``dataFormatTypes'' enumerations: added ``McIDAS-AREA'' and
``text/html''.
* ``variableNameVocabulary'' enumerations: deprecated ``GRIB''; added
``GRIB-1'' and ``GRIB-2'' +

Changes to elements and attributes:

* ``catalog'' element: deprecated the ``base'' attribute (not working in
code, should follow XLink spec).
* ``variable'' element: added the ``vocabulary_id'' attribute.
* ``property'' element: require both ``name'' and ``value''
attributes. +

== Changes for version 1.0.1

* The version attribute is ``1.0.1'' .
* The schema can be found
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/schemas/thredds/InvCatalog.1.0.1.xsd[here].
However, you should tell your parser to resolve to a local copy of it,
both for performance and to decouple with Unidataâ€™s web server.

=== Catalog base attribute

The optional attribute *base* can be added to the catalog element to
define a base URL. All relative URLs in the document are interpreted
against base URL. This follows thehttp://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/[XML Base
specification], which in turn references the
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt[specification of URIs]**.**

=== DatasetType type

The *dataset* definition is now made in the *DatasetType* type, and
*catalogRef* and *datasetScan* extend from it and are in the same
substitution group. This means that you can use a *catalogRef* and
*datasetScan* wherever a *dataset* is allowed. This simplifies the
schema slightly. There are a few important effects of this:

1.  *catalogRef* now _*is-a*_ dataset, and can have any and all metadata
that a *dataset* can have.
2.  *catalogRef* must have a *name* attribute, since that is required on
a **dataset**. The *name* is ignored, in favor of the *xlink:title*
attribute. This is the only (slightly) backward incompatible change, and
only affects validation.

=== metadata element

1.  process other namespaces with ``lax'' attribute, meaning validate if
a schema can be found

=== timeCoverageType type

1.  some technical corrections to simplify the schema, no semantic
changes.

=== variables element

1.  *vocabulary* attribute is now optional on a *variables* element
2.  *vocabulary_name* attribute is now optional on a *variable* element
3.  the *variable* element is now __mixed content__, meaning you can add
text content, which is interpreted as a description of the variable.

=== Enumeration changes

All enumeration values should be tested case-insensitive.

1.  *collectionTypes:* add _ForecastModelRuns_
2.  *dataTypes:* add _Point, Radial_
3.  **dataFormatTypes**: add __NEXRAD2__, __NIDS__, _GINI_
4.  *dateEnumTypes:* add _metadataCreated_

== Other requests

* Allow a variable element to map to more than one vocabulary (Luca)
* Add _last update time_ of the catalog, for caching. Could use HTTP
headers. (Benno, LEAD).
* _Extended inheritance_ across catalog references (Michael Burek)
