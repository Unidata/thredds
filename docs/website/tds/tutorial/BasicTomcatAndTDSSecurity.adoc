== Tomcat `manager` Application: A Word Of Caution

=== About the `manager` application

==== More about `manager`

For more information about the Tomcat `         manager       `
application, see the Tomcat
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/manager-howto.html[Manager App
HOW-TO] documentation.

* ``Free'' web application that comes with Tomcat distribution.
* Lives in the `manager` directory in the Tomcat `webapps/` directory.
* Allows Tomcat administrators to deploy, undeploy, or reload web
applications such as the TDS without having to shut down and restart
Tomcat.
* Provides server status statistics for the JVM and each connector you
have configured in `server.xml`.

=== Accessing the Tomcat `manager` application

==== Changes to the `manager` application

The `         manager       ` application URLs and roles has been
re-structured. See the Tomcat
http://tomcat.apache.org/migration.html[Migration guide] for more
information.

Attempt to access the Tomcat `       manager     ` application in your
browser: http://localhost:8080/manager/html/. You will be prompted to
login via BASIC authentication, which will end in failure since we do
not yet have permission to access the `         manager       `
application:

link:images/manager401.png[image:images/manager401.png[Manager app with
401 response code]]

Based on what we know about Tomcat configuration, which file in the
Tomcat `         conf/       ` directory should we edit to grant
ourselves access to the `         manager       ` application?

=== Granting access to the `manager` application

1.  Modify `tomcat-users.xml` to add a `user` element.
2.  Restart Tomcat and log into the `manager` application.

==== Troubleshooting tips

* Check the XML syntax in `           tomcat-users.xml         ` to make
sure it is well-formed and without error.
* Did you restart Tomcat after you made your changes to
`           tomcat-users.xml         `?
* Any errors will be reported in the Tomcat
`           logs/catalina.out         ` file.

=== Caveat of the `manager` application

==== `PermGen` info

For a really good description of the issue, see this series of three
articles:

* "http://my.opera.com/karmazilla/blog/2007/09/29/return-of-the-permgen[Return
of the PermGen]" (2007-09-29)
* "http://my.opera.com/karmazilla/blog/2007/03/15/permgen-strikes-back[PermGen
Strikes Back]" (2007-03-15)
* "http://my.opera.com/karmazilla/blog/2007/03/13/good-riddance-permgen-outofmemoryerror[Good
Riddance PermGen OutOfMemoryError]" (2007-03-13)

The dreaded
`       java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space failure     ` error:

* *The issue:* The ``PermGen'' error happens when the JVM runs out of
memory in the permanent generation. (Default PermGen size differs among
Sun JDK versions, but the upper limit is typically 64MB.)
* *The cause:* Objects in the permanent generation are never garbage
collected. When redeploying your web application using the Tomcat
`         manager       ` application, your WAR file is unpacked and
parts of the class file definition are loaded into PermGen space, like
string constants.
* *The symptom:* The PermGen error will manifest itself in a sluggish
Tomcat `         manager       ` application that never completes a
task, and the
`         java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space failure       `
error being displayed in
`         ${tomcat_home}/logs/catalina.out       `
* *A temporary fix:* You can add the `         -XX:MaxPermSize       `
switch to `         $JAVA_OPTS       ` to increase the amount of memory
allocated for the permanent generation, However this is only postponed
the inevitable, as even an increased memory in permanent generation will
eventually fill up. When this happens, you will need to stop/start
Tomcat at this point. For this reason, you may want to restart Tomcat
whenever you redeploy TDS or another webapp.

== Using Digested Passwords

=== The problem of passwords in clear text

==== Tomcat Realms

The Tomcat documentation contains a wealth of information about the
different
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/realm.html[Tomcat
Realms].

* Passwords stored in clear text are a vulnerability if the host is
compromised.
* Better to have the passwords encrypted using a cryptographic hash
functions (SHA, MD2, or MD5) and then stored in
`         tomcat-users.xml       ` file in the Tomcat
`         conf/       ` directory.
* Tomcat can be configured to support digested passwords (this is not
the default setting).
* How it works: When a client makes a request Tomcat will tell the
client that a digested password is required. Based on this dialog, the
client will automatically digest the password entered by the user.

=== Configure Tomcat to use digested passwords

First we need to enable digest passwords support in Tomcat by modifying
a couple of Tomcat Realms in the `server.xml` file in the Tomcat `conf/`
directory.

A http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/realm.html[Tomcat
Realm] represents a ``database'' of usernames, passwords, and roles
assigned to tomcat users.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Realm Name |Purpose
|`UserDatabaseRealm` |The `UserDatabaseRealm` is enabled by default and
reads clear text user password information stored in `tomcat-users.xml`.

|`MemoryRealm` |The `MemoryRealm` reads the user password information
stored in the `tomcat-users.xml` in a specified encrypted format.
|=======================================================================

Open the `         server.xml       ` with your favorite editor:

---------------
$ vi server.xml
---------------

Locate the `         UserDatabaseRealm       ` (right above the
`         Host       ` element) and comment it out:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- This Realm uses the UserDatabase configured in the global JNDI
     resources under the key "UserDatabase".  Any edits
     that are performed against this UserDatabase are immediately
     available for use by the Realm.  -->
<!--
<Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.UserDatabaseRealm"
       resourceName="UserDatabase"/>
-->
<!-- Define the default virtual host
     Note: XML Schema validation will not work with Xerces 2.2.
-->
<Host name="localhost"  appBase="webapps"
      unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true"
      xmlValidation="false" xmlNamespaceAware="false">
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Now add the following `         MemoryRealm       ` information inside
the `         Host       ` element:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- This Realm uses the UserDatabase configured in the global JNDI
     resources under the key "UserDatabase".  Any edits
     that are performed against this UserDatabase are immediately
     available for use by the Realm.  -->
<!--
<Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.UserDatabaseRealm"
       resourceName="UserDatabase"/>
-->
<!-- Define the default virtual host
     Note: XML Schema validation will not work with Xerces 2.2.
-->
<Host name="localhost"  appBase="webapps"
      unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true"
      xmlValidation="false" xmlNamespaceAware="false">

    <Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.MemoryRealm"
      digest="SHA" />
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a SHA encrypted version of your password.

Tomcat provides a script
(`         ${tomcat_home}/bin/digest.sh       `) that will encrypt a
password string according to the algorithm specified. Use this script as
follows with the password you made for yourself previously:

------------------------------------------------------------
$ /home/tds/apache-tomcat-6.0.32/bin/digest.sh -a SHA secret
secret:e5e9fa1ba31ecd1ae84f75caaa474f3a663f05f4
------------------------------------------------------------

Update `tomcat-users.xml`.

Replace your clear-text password in `         tomcat-users.xml       `
with the encrypted version:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<tomcat-users>
    <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
    <user username="admin" password="e5e9fa1ba31ecd1ae84f75caaa474f3a663f05f4" roles="manager-gui"/>
</tomcat-users>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verify digest passwords have been successfully enabled in Tomcat.

==== BASIC authentication

Since we are using BASIC authentication, you will need to clear any
authenticated sessions in your browser to test whether digested
passwords have been enabled.

Restart Tomcat and verify digest passwords have been successfully
enabled by logging into the Tomcat `         manager       ` application
using your password in clear text: http://localhost:8080/manager/html/

==== Troubleshooting tips

* Check the XML syntax in `             tomcat-users.xml           ` and
`             server.xml           ` to make sure it is well-formed and
without error.
* Did you restart Tomcat after you made your changes to
`             tomcat-users.xml           ` and
`             server.xml           ` ?
* Any errors will be reported in the
`             catalina.out           ` file in the Tomcat
`             logs/           ` directory.
* You do not need to type the encrypted version of your password into
the browser (the browser auto-magically encrypts your password for you
before it transmits it to the server).

=== Exercise One: Configure Tomcat to use digested passwords

1.  Using the steps outlined above, enable digested passwords in Tomcat.

== Enabling SSL Encryption

=== About Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

==== How SSL works

For more information on how SSL works, Wikipedia details the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#How_it_works[steps
involved] during an SSL transaction.

* Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a cryptographic protocol that provides
security and data integrity for communications over TCP/IP networks.
* SSL allows applications to communicate across a network in a way
designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.
* SSL uses a cryptographic system that uses two keys to encrypt data: a
public key known to everyone and a private or secret key known only to
the recipient of the message.
* By convention, URLs that require an SSL connection start with `https`
instead of `http`.

=== SSL certificates

A public key certificate is an electronic document which incorporates a
digital signature to bind together a public key with identity
information of the certificate user.

The certificate can be used to verify that a public key belongs to an
individual.

The digital signature can be signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) or
the certificate user (a self-signed certificate).

Unidata recommends the use of a certificate signed by a Certificate
Authority (CA).

=== Accessing the TDS remote management tool

Other than the compelling security reasons, you will want to enable SSL
to take advantage of the TDS remote management tool which
(out-of-the-box) requires SSL in order to access:
http://localhost:8080/thredds/admin/debug

Configure Tomcat to enable SSL and use the self-signed certificate.

Based on what we know about Tomcat configuration, which file in
`         ${tomcat_home}/conf       ` should we edit to to enable SSL?

Open `       ${tomcat_home}/conf/server.xml     ` with your favorite
editor:

---------------
$ vi server.xml
---------------

Locate the `       Java HTTP/1.1 Connector     ` listening on port 8080
and verify it is redirecting SSL traffic to port 8443:

------------------------------------------
<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
              connectionTimeout="20000"
              redirectPort="8443" />
------------------------------------------

Find and uncomment the `       SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector     ` listening on
port 8443 to activate this connector:

------------------------------------------------------------
<Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
              maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
              clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" />
------------------------------------------------------------

Add a `       keystoreFile     ` attribute to the
`       SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector     ` to tell Tomcat where to find the
keystore:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
              maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
              clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" keystoreFile="/home/tds/tds/apache-tomcat-6.0.32/conf/keystore" />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since we opted to not use the default `       keystore password     `,
we need to specify the new password so Tomcat can open the file:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
              maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
              clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" keystoreFile="/home/tds/tds/apache-tomcat-6.0.32/conf/keystore" keystorePass="foobar" />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, verify the `       AprLifecycleListener     ` is uncommented
(found near the top of the file):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!--APR library loader. Documentation at /docs/apr.html -->
<Listener className="org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener" SSLEngine="on" />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verify SSL has been enabled.

Restart Tomcat:

--------------------------------
$ ${tomcat_home}/bin/shutdown.sh
$ ${tomcat_home}/bin/startup.sh
--------------------------------

Verify Tomcat is listening on port 8443 by running the
`       netstat     ` command:

------------------------
$ netstat -an | grep tcp
------------------------

==== `man netstat`

Run `         man netstat       ` in your terminal window to learn more
about this command.

`       netstat     ` (short for **net**work **stat**istics) is
available on Unix, Unix-like, and Windows NT-based operating systems. It
is a command-line tool that displays:

* network connections (both incoming and outgoing)
* routing tables
* and a number of network interface statistics

Look for the following in the output:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8443               0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Troubleshooting tips

* Check the XML syntax in `           server.xml         ` to make sure
it is well-formed and without error.
* When generating the self-signed certificate, the last password (the
`           key password         `) and
`           keystore password         ` should be the same
(`           changeit         `). If they differ, Tomcat cannot open the
keystore and you will get this error:
`           java.io.IOException: Cannot recover key         `.
* Did you restart Tomcat after you made your changes to
`           server.xml         `?
* Did you specify the full path to the `           keystore         `
file in `           server.xml         `?

=== Exercise Four: Grant yourself access to the TDS remote management
tool

1.  Using the steps outlined above, create a self-signed certificate and
enable SSL in Tomcat.
2.  Modify `       ${tomcat_home}/conf/tomcat-users.xml     ` to add a
new role with the rolename attribute of `       tdsConfig     `, and add
this role to your list of roles:
3.  Restart Tomcat and try to access the TDS remote management tool:
http://localhost:8080/thredds/admin/debug[http://localhost:8080/thredds/admin/debug/]

=== Configuring web applications for SSL

How did Tomcat know to use SSL for the TDS remote management tool?

Where, in any of the configuration changes you made to
`       ${tomcat_home}/conf/server.xml     ` or
`       ${tomcat_home}/conf/tomcat-users.xml     `, did you explicitly
specify that TDS remote management tool _must_ be accessed via SSL?

=== The missing piece: `/WEB-INF/web.xml`

* This is specified in the web application deployment descriptor, aka
`web.xml`.
* Deployment descriptors are found in the `WEB-INF` directory of the web
application: `<application name>/WEB-INF/web.xml`.
* By convention, Tomcat and other servlet containers will read the web
application deployment descriptors for initialization parameters and
container-managed security constraints upon application deployment.
* The TDS has been pre-configured to require that SSL encryption is
enabled in order to access the remote management tool.

=== Looking at the TDS deployment descriptor

Have a look at the deployment descriptor that comes with the TDS.

Navigate to the unpacked `       thredds     ` directory in
`       ${tomcat_home}/webapps     `, and view the file:

-------------------------------------------------------
$ cd /home/tds/tds/apache-tomcat-6.0.32/webapps/thredds
$ less WEB-INF/web.xml
-------------------------------------------------------

Look for a reference to the TDS remote management tool’s URL
(`       /admin/debug     `).

Near the bottom of the deployment descriptor you will find this entry:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <!-- This allows "remote configuration":
    /thredds/admin/debug gives access to various debug and status info.
    /thredds/admin/content/ -> "{tomcat_home}/content/thredds/"
    /thredds/admin/root/ -> "{tomcat_home}/webapps/thredds/" DISABLED
    /thredds/admin/dataDir/path -> "{dataRoot(path)}/webapps/thredds/"  DISABLED
   -->
  <security-constraint>
    <web-resource-collection>
      <web-resource-name>sensitive read access</web-resource-name>
      <url-pattern>/admin/*</url-pattern>
      <http-method>GET</http-method>
      <!-- http-method>PUT</http-method -->
    </web-resource-collection>
    <auth-constraint>
      <role-name>tdsConfig</role-name>
    </auth-constraint>
    <user-data-constraint>
      <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
      </user-data-constraint>
  </security-constraint>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Configuration help

For more information on how to configure security requirements for a web
application in a deployment descriptor, see:
http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bncbe.html[Defining
Security Requirements for Web Applications].

The `         <user-data-constraint>       ` establishes a requirement
that the constrained requests be received over a protected transport
layer connection. This guarantees how the data will be transported
between client and server.

`         <transport-guarantee>       ` choices for type of transport
guarantee include `         NONE       `, `         INTEGRAL       `,
and `         CONFIDENTIAL       `:

1.  Specify `           CONFIDENTIAL         ` when the application
requires that data be transmitted so as to prevent other entities from
observing the contents of the transmission. (E.g., via SSL.)
2.  Specify `           INTEGRAL         ` when the application requires
that the data be sent between client and server in such a way that it
cannot be changed in transit.
3.  Specify `           NONE         ` to indicate that the container
must accept the constrained requests on any connection, including an
unprotected one.

=== Enabling SSL for the Tomcat `manager` application

Modify the deployment descriptor of the Tomcat `manager` application.

Using your favorite editor, open the deployment descriptor for the
Tomcat `       manager     ` application:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ vi /home/tds/tds/apache-tomcat-6.0.32/webapps/manager/WEB-INF/web.xml
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Locate the `       <security-constraint>     ` element (near the bottom
of the file):

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <!-- Define a Security Constraint on this Application -->
  <security-constraint>
    <web-resource-collection>
      <web-resource-name>HTMLManger and Manager command</web-resource-name>
      <url-pattern>/jmxproxy/*</url-pattern>
      <url-pattern>/html/*</url-pattern>
      <url-pattern>/list</url-pattern>
      <url-pattern>/expire</url-pattern>
      <url-pattern>/sessions</url-pattern>

      <url-pattern>/save</url-pattern>
      <url-pattern>/serverinfo</url-pattern>
      <url-pattern>/status/*</url-pattern>
      <url-pattern>/roles</url-pattern>
      <url-pattern>/resources</url-pattern>
    </web-resource-collection>
    <auth-constraint>
       <!-- NOTE:  This role is not present in the default users file -->
       <role-name>manager</role-name>
    </auth-constraint>
  </security-constraint>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The comment in the `       <auth-constraint>     ` element is no longer
correct:

`       <!-- NOTE: This role is not present in the default users file -->     `

(Since we’ve already added the `       role     ` of
`       manager     ` to the `       tomcat-users.xml     ` file, we
might as well remove the comment.)

Add a `       <user-data-constraint>     ` with a
`       <transport-guarantee>     ` of `       CONFIDENTIAL     ` to
enable port-forwarding to port 8443:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <!-- Define a Security Constraint on this Application -->
  <security-constraint>
    <web-resource-collection>
      <web-resource-name>HTMLManger and Manager command</web-resource-name>

==== Troubleshooting tips

* Check the XML syntax in `           web.xml         ` to make sure it
is well-formed and without error.
* Did you specify a `           <transport-guarantee>         ` of
`           CONFIDENTIAL         `?
* Did you restart Tomcat after you made your changes to
`           web.xml         `?
