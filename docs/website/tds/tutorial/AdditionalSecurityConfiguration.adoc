= TDS Tutorial: Additional Security Configuration

We have compiled a list of a few additional step you should take to help
secure Tomcat and your TDS server. _This is not a complete laundry list
of security fixes!_ Please use it as a starting point when securing your
server.

== Keep Tomcat, Java and the TDS up-to-date

Running the most current versions of software keeps your environment
protected against _known_
http://www.securityfocus.com/vulnerabilities[security vulnerabilities].

Resources to help stay informed:

* http://tomcat.apache.org/security.html[Tomcat security reports] +
 A complete list of known and documented security vulnerabilities
associated with each Tomcat release.
* http://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html[`tomcat-users` mailing list] +
 A high-traffic mailing list made up of Tomcat users. New releases of
Tomcat are likely to be announced here.
* http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/security/[Java SE Security] +
 Sun’s Java security page which includes a chronology of Java security
issues and user forums.
* http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/mailing_lists/[`thredds` mailing list] +
 The THREDDS mailing list where announcements of new releases will be
made.
* http://www.securityfocus.com/vulnerabilities[Buqtraq vunerability
database] +
 SecurityFocus’ database of all known vulnerabilities for all different
types of software from different vendors.

== Removing the default Tomcat web applications

It is generally good practice to remove any un-used web applications out
of `${tomcat_home}/webapps`. Tomcat ships with several default web
applications, that you may want to consider removing if they are not
being utilized:

* The `ROOT` application is Tomcat’s `DocumentRoot` and contains the
server’s main web page. Give thought tot he content that is placed in
`ROOT/`, as it will be readily available. (Note: if you want to utilize
a `robots.txt` file to restrict crawler activity, `ROOT/` is the place
it will go.)
* The `manager` application is used for remote management of web
applications. To use this application, you must add a user with role of
`manager` in `tomcat-users.xml`. Obviously, if you are not planning to
use the `manager` application, it should be removed.
* The `host-manager` application is used for management of virtual
hosts. To use this application, you must add a user with role of
`host-manager` in `tomcat-users.xml`. If you are not planning to do a
lot of virtual hosting in Tomcat this application should be removed.
* The `examples` application should probably be removed from a
production server to minimize security exposure.
* The `docs` are a copy of the
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/[Tomcat documentation found
online]. Unless you have need for a local copy, removing `docs` would
help to tidy-up `${tomcat_home}/webapps`.

== Denying access to the TDS by remote IP address or host

Use the `RemoteHostValve` or `RemoteAddrValve` to restrict access to the
TDS. For example, the following `Valve` declarations show ways to either
_allow_ or _deny_ access to content (note that the allow and deny values
are comma separated lists of regular expressions):

---------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- This example denies access based on IP addresses -->
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
       deny="128\.117\.47\.201,128\.107\.157\.210,96\.33\.56\.215" />
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- This example denies access based on host names -->
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteHostValve"
           deny="www\.badguys\.com,www\.bandwidthhog\.net" />
-------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- Wildcard characters can with the both valves -->
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
       deny="128\.117\.47\..*" />
-------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- This example only allows the specified IPs to access  -->
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
          allow="128\.117\.140\..*" />
--------------------------------------------------------------

The last example above would be a good candidate to utilize for adding
an extra layer of security to the `manager` application if you were
certain it would only need to be accessed from within a specific range
of IP address.

__Note__: These valves rely on incoming IP addresses or hostnames which
are vulnerable to spoofing.

For more information, see the Tomcat
http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html[Valve Component] documentation.

== Blocking TDS content from being indexed by web crawlers

Use a `robots.txt` file to prevent crawlers from indexing content.

The TDS provides a basic and very restrictive `robots.txt` file for you
to use:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-bash-3.2$ less ${tomcat_home}/webapps/thredds/WEB-INF/initialContent/root/robots.txt
# disallow everything
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "`User-agent: *`" means this section applies to all robots. The
"`Disallow: /`" tells the robot that it should not visit any pages on
the site.

To active the `robots.txt` file, you will need to move it to Tomcat’s
`DocumentRoot`:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-bash-3.2$ cd  ${tomcat_home}/webapps/ROOT
-bash-3.2$ cp ${tomcat_home}/webapps/thredds/WEB-INF/initialContent/root/robots.txt .
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

__Note__: not all crawlers obey the `robots.txt` file.

For more information, see: http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html.

== Running Tomcat as a user other than `root`

**Background info**: The JVM doesn’t fork at all, nor does it support
`setuid()` calls. The JVM (and therefore Tomcat) is one process. The JVM
is a virtual machine with many threads under the same process. Because
of OS constraints - all threads in the same process must run under the
same user id. No thread may run as root unless they are all root.

Hence, any programs run in Tomcat (TDS, `manager` application, other
JSPs and servlets) will run as the `root` user.

**The scenario**: Imagine an attacker who manages to exploit a weakness
in Tomcat or something running in `webapps/` to run arbitrary commands:
__those commands will be run as the superuser__!

**The solution**: We strongly discourage running Tomcat as the `root`
user and recommend creating a dedicated user and group for running the
Tomcat process.

* Creating the dedicated user and group for running Tomcat both called:
`tomcat`. `/opt/tomcat` is the home directory of the `tomcat` user. The
`groupadd` and `useradd` commands were run as the `root`:
* Changing permission in `${tomcat_home}` for the new user:
* Modify any scripts you have for server `init` processes to invoke the
`tomcat` user:

== Blocking non-essential port access at the firewall

Type the following in your terminal window:

--------------------------------
-bash-3.2$ telnet localhost 8005
--------------------------------

When prompted, issue Tomcat the shutdown command by typing `SHUTDOWN`:

-------------------------
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
SHUTDOWN
-------------------------

This should have shutdown Tomcat. Confirm this by running the `ps`
command:

-----------------------------------------------------------
Connection to localhost closed by foreign host.
-bash-3.2$ ps -ef | grep tomcat
thredds  21715 21682  0 14:02 pts/2    00:00:00 grep tomcat
-----------------------------------------------------------

This example showed how easy it was issue commands to Tomcat if you
know:

1.  the correct port number; and
2.  the command expected on that port.

.

Unless you are on a private network, you need a firewall to restrict who
is allowed to access network ports. We recommend working with you
systems/network administrator to block access to all non-essential ports
at the firewall. For running the TDS, keep in mind the following:

* Port 8080 should have unrestricted access _unless_ you plan to proxy
requests to Tomcat from and HTTP server.
* If you are allowing any remote management by using the TDS Remote
Management Tool or the Tomcat `manager` application, you must also open
up port 8443.

== Running Tomcat behind an HTTP server

It is not uncommon to run Tomcat as an application server behind an HTTP
server. Tomcat has a couple of different
http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/[connectors] that allow you to
set up this configuration:

* http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/ajp.html[AJP]
* http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/proxy-howto.html[mod_proxy on
Apache HTTP Server 2.x]

For an interesting analysis on Tomcat performance when run as an
application server behind an HTTP server, see the
http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596101060/chapter/ch04.pdf[Tomcat Tuning]
free online chapter in
http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596101060/index.html[Tomcat: The
Definitive Guide] (2007). Check out the timings between Tomcat and
Apache.

For more information on Tomcat connectors in general, see the Tomcat
connector http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/[Documentation Index].

== Running Tomcat under a JVM Security Manager

The JVM Security Manager that comes with Tomcat imposes a fine-grained
security restrictions to all Java applications running the JVM. It
confines the Java applications in a sandbox, and restricts them from
utilizing certain features of the Java language Tomcat normally is able
to access.

There are pros and cons to using the Security Manager. If are hosting
untrusted servlets or JSP on your server, then implementing the Security
Manager may be a good idea. Be aware the Security Manager may prevent
trusted web applications (like the TDS) from performing certain
functions if configured to restrictively.

For more information about the Security Manager, see the Tomcat
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/security-manager-howto.html[Security
Manager HOW-TO] documentation.
