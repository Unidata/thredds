= OGC/ISO Services (WCS, WMS, and ncISO)

== Setting up WCS, WMS, and ncISO

=== Configure TDS to Allow WCS, WMS, and ncISO Access

Out of the box, the TDS distribution will have WCS, WMS, and ncISO
disabled. They must be explicitly allowed in the `threddsConfig.xml`
file. The default `threddsConfig.xml` file (which should now be in your
`${tomcat_home}/content/thredds` directory) contains commented out
sections for each of these services.

==== WCS Configuration

To enable the <<../reference/services/WCS#,WCS service>> for locally served
datasets, you will need the following in your `threddsConfig.xml` file:

---------------------
<WCS>
  <allow>true</allow>
</WCS>
---------------------

Additional WCS configuration options can be set in the
`threddsConfig.xml` file, more details are available in the
<<../reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile#WCS,WCS section>> of the
`threddsConfig.xml` file documentation.

[[wms_configuration]]
==== WMS Configuration

To enable the <<../reference/services/WMS#,WMS service>> for locally served
datasets, you will need the following in your `threddsConfig.xml` file:

---------------------
<WMS>
  <allow>true</allow>
</WMS>
---------------------

Additional WMS configuration options can be set in the
`threddsConfig.xml` file, more details are available in the
<<../reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile#WMS,WMS section>> of the
`threddsConfig.xml` file documentation.

==== ncISO Configuration

To enable the <<../reference/services/ncISO#,ncISO services>> for locally
served datasets, you will need the following in your `threddsConfig.xml`
file:

-----------------------------
<NCISO>
  <ncmlAllow>true</ncmlAllow>
  <uddcAllow>true</uddcAllow>
  <isoAllow>true</isoAllow>
</NCISO>
-----------------------------

Each "`*Allow`" element allows one of the three ncISO services.

=== Adding WCS and WMS Services

Once the WCS and WMS services are enabled, all that is required for the
TDS to provide WCS and WMS access to datasets is for those datasets to
reference WCS and WMS service elements. Adding them to an existing
compound service would look something like this:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<service name="grid" serviceType="Compound" base="" >
    <service name="odap" serviceType="OpenDAP" base="/thredds/dodsC/" />
    <service name="wcs" serviceType="WCS" base="/thredds/wcs/" />
    <service name="wms" serviceType="WMS" base="/thredds/wms/" />
    <service name="ncss" serviceType="NetcdfSubset" base="/thredds/ncss/" />
    <service name="http" serviceType="HTTPServer" base="/thredds/fileServer/" />
</service>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Adding ncISO Services

Similar to above, once the ncISO services are enabled, all that is
required for the TDS to provide ncISO services on datasets is for those
datasets to reference the ncISO service elements. For instance, adding
to the same compound service as above:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<service name="grid" serviceType="Compound" base="" >
    <service name="odap" serviceType="OpenDAP" base="/thredds/dodsC/" />
    <service name="wcs" serviceType="WCS" base="/thredds/wcs/" />
    <service name="wms" serviceType="WMS" base="/thredds/wms/" />
    <service name="ncss" serviceType="NetcdfSubset" base="/thredds/ncss/" />
    <service name="http" serviceType="HTTPServer" base="/thredds/fileServer/" />
    <service name="ncml" serviceType="NCML" base="/thredds/ncml/" />
    <service name="uddc" serviceType="UDDC" base="/thredds/uddc/" />
    <service name="iso" serviceType="ISO" base="/thredds/iso/" />
</service>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Exercise: Setup WCS and WMS Access for NAM Data

1.  Edit the TDS configuration file and allow WCS and WMS services as
discussed above
+
-----------------------------------
$ cd ${tomcat_home}/content/thredds
$ vi threddsConfig.xml
-----------------------------------
+
and add/replace the WCS and WMS elements (as described above)
+
----------------------
<WCS>
  <allow>true </allow>
</WCS>
<WMS>
  <allow>true </allow>
</WMS>
----------------------
2.  Edit the *catalog.xml* file and add WCS and WMS services to the NAM
dataset
+
-------------------------------------------------------------
<service name="wcs" serviceType="WCS" base="/thredds/wcs/" />
<service name="wms" serviceType="WMS" base="/thredds/wms/" />
-------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Restart Tomcat so the TDS is reinitialized:
+
-----------------------
$ cd ${tomcat_home}/bin
$ ./shutdown.sh
$ ./startup.sh
-----------------------
4.  Test that WCS and WMS are working:
.. 1.  Bring the catalog up in a browser:
`http://localhost:8080/thredds/catalog.html`
.. 2.  Click down to one of the NAM dataset pages.
.. 3.  Select the WCS Access link
.. 4.  Go back, select the WMS Access link
.. 5.  Check Dataset Viewer Links for Godiva2 (ToolsUI and Godiva2 are
there but IDV is not).

=== Adding ``Grid'' DataType to Datasets

Once datasets are accessible over the WMS and WCS services, a quick look
at the dataset pages shows several ``Viewer'' links available for each
dataset (ToolsUI and Godiva2). The IDV ``Viewer'' link is only added for
datasets with a ``Grid'' data type. This is not whether the dataset is
recognized by the CDM as gridded but rather if the metadata in the
catalog indicates that the dataset is a ``Grid''. This is accomplished
with the `dataType` metadata element:

-------------------------
<dataType>Grid</dataType>
-------------------------

=== Exercise: Add ``Grid'' DataType to the NAM Data

1.  Edit the *catalog.xml* file and add a Grid `dataType` element (as
above) to the NAM dataset.
2.  Restart Tomcat so the TDS is reinitialized:
+
-----------------------
$ cd ${tomcat_home}/bin
$ ./shutdown.sh
$ ./startup.sh
-----------------------
3.  Check the dataset pages for the IDV Viewer link.

[[detailed_wms_configuration]]
== More WMS Configuration

Besides the basic WMS configuration available in the `threddsConfig.xml`
file, there are additional configuration settings in the `wmsConfig.xml`
file. These settings can be applied globally, by dataset, or by variable
in a dataset, or to variables in any dataset by CF standard name.

=== Default Image Styling

There are additional configuration settings for default image styling
including settings for the default values of color scale range, palette
name, and number of color bands as well as whether to use a linear or
logarithmic scale.

Detailed information is available from the ncWMS/MyOcean
http://www.resc.reading.ac.uk/trac/myocean-tools/wiki/WmsDetailedConfiguration[WMS
Detailed Configuration] web page.

=== Interval Time vs Full Time List in GetCapabilities Documents

By default, the WMS will list all time values in a GetCapabilities
document. For long time-series, this list can cause the GetCapabilities
document to be quite large. Datasets/variables can be configured to use
time intervals with the addition of an `intervalTime` element in the
`wmsConfig.xml` file. For instance:

---------------------------------
<intervalTime>true</intervalTime>

---------------------------------

Unfortunately, though time intervals are part of the WMS specification,
not all WMS clients know how to interpret time intervals in the
GetCapabilities document.

=== Exercise: Try Modifying the `wmsConfig.xml` File

1.  Open a dataset in Godiva2 and plot a parameter.
2.  Notice the default color scale range is [-50,50]. Decide on a better
color scale range.
3.  Open the
"http://www.resc.reading.ac.uk/trac/myocean-tools/wiki/WmsDetailedConfiguration[WMS
Detailed Configuration]" page in your browser.
4.  Edit the wmsConfig.xml file
+
-----------------------------------
$ cd ${tomcat_home}/content/thredds
$ vi wmsConfig.xml
-----------------------------------
+
and change the color scale range for the target parameter in the chosen
dataset.
5.  Reopen Godiva2 on the dataset and plot the target parameter. Check
the new default color scale range.

[[styling_extensions]]
== Styling features and non-standard requests

ncWMS provides several styling and displaying capabilities that are also
available in TDS:

* The WMS tries to identify vector components that it can combine and
display as a single vector layer. It looks for CF `standard_name`
attributes with values of the form ``eastward_*'' and ``northward_*''
and combines those that match into a vector layer.
* ncWMS provides several vector styles: barb, stumpvec, trivec, linevec,
fancyvec.http://oos.soest.hawaii.edu/pacioos/voyager/[Demo]
* Some styling properties can be specified through the
http://www.resc.rdg.ac.uk/trac/ncWMS/wiki/WmsExtensions[non-standard
optional parameters] supported by ncWMS
* Some non-standard requests are supported by ncWMS:
1.  GetTransect
2.  GetVerticalProfile
3.  GetVerticalSection

=== Exercise: WMS request with styling parameters

1.  Open the
http://www.resc.rdg.ac.uk/trac/ncWMS/wiki/WmsExtensions[non-standard
optional parameters] supported by ncWMS page
2.  Make several WMS request changing the color scale range and the
displaying properties for the values out of range.
3.  Use
