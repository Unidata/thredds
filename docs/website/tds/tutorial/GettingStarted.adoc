== Installing Java and Tomcat

=== System requirements

==== JDK installation help

Users of GCJ and OS-provided packages (linux) for Java and/or Tomcat may want to reference the http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/mailing_lists/archives/thredds/[THREDDS mailing list] for installation help.

* Oracle Java 8 (latest version)
* Apache Tomcat 8.x

While there are different distributors of Java and servlet containers, Unidata develops, uses and tests the THREDDS Data Server using _Oracle Java_ and the _Apache Tomcat_ servlet container.

=== Installing Java

1.  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/[Download] current Java SE Developer Kit (JDK) from Oracle. Use the latest 1.8 version of the JDK.
2.  Install the JDK as per the Oracle http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html[installation instructions].

=== Installing Tomcat

==== Tomcat on Windows

For more information about installing Tomcat on Windows OS, see the http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/setup.html#Windows[Tomcat setup guide] for installation on different platforms.

1.  http://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi[Download] current version of the Tomcat 8 servlet container.
2.  Install Tomcat as per the Apache Tomcat http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/setup.html[installation instructions].

[[tour]]
== Tomcat Directory Structure: Quick Tour

=== Exploring the Tomcat directory structure

Examine the Tomcat directory structure, aka `${tomcat_home}`.

Move into `${tomcat_home}` and do a long listing:

[source,bash]
----------------------------------------------------------
$ cd apache-tomcat-8.0.24
$ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x 2 tds workshop  4096 Jul 15 09:37 bin
drwxr-xr-x 2 tds workshop  4096 Jul  2 01:59 conf
drwxr-xr-x 2 tds workshop  4096 Jul 15 09:37 lib
-rw-r--r-- 1 tds workshop 56812 Jul  2 01:59 LICENSE
drwxr-xr-x 2 tds workshop  4096 Jul  2 01:57 logs
-rw-r--r-- 1 tds workshop  1192 Jul  2 01:59 NOTICE
-rw-r--r-- 1 tds workshop  8826 Jul  2 01:59 RELEASE-NOTES

drwxr-xr-x 2 tds workshop  4096 Jul 15 09:37 temp
drwxr-xr-x 7 tds workshop  4096 Jul  2 01:59 webapps
drwxr-xr-x 2 tds workshop  4096 Jul  2 01:57 work
----------------------------------------------------------

Familiarize yourself with the following important directories.

`bin/`

* Contains `startup.sh`, `shutdown.sh` and other scripts/programs.
* The `*.sh files` (for Unix systems) are functional duplicates of the
`*.bat` files (for Windows systems).

`conf/`

* _Server-wide_ Tomcat configuration.
* You will modify `server.xml` and `tomcat-users.xml` to adjust logging,
authentication and access control, enable SSL, etc.
* Web applications can override some server-wide settings in their own
configuration files (more about that later).

`webapps/`

* Contains web applications directories and WAR files.
* This is where we will be putting the TDS web application.
* You will also be using the `manager` application that comes with
Tomcat during this workshop.

`logs/`

* _Tomcat log files_ are here by default.
* This is one of the directories you will be looking for log files (the
TDS logs elsewhere by default).
* _The log files should be your first stop for troubleshooting Tomcat
and TDS issues._ (Hint, hint.)
* Logs files may contain useful information for assessing the security
of your system.
* You will become very familiar with the Tomcat-generated
`catalina.out`, `catalina.yyyy-mm-dd.log` and
`localhost_access_log.yyyy-mm-dd.log` files by the end of this workshop.

[[running]]
== Running Tomcat

=== Starting & stopping Tomcat

1.  Tomcat isn’t currently running so we need to start it up.
2.  Verify Tomcat is running.
3.  See if you can shutdown Tomcat.

Which Java is Tomcat currently using? (Hint: what was sent to `STDOUT`
when running the `startup.sh` and `shutdown.sh`?)

==== Troubleshooting

* Check the logs mostly recently generated in the Tomcat `logs` for
clues about why Tomcat failed to start or stop.
* Pay particular attention to what is being reported in Tomcat’s main
log file: `catalina.out`.

=== Setting `$JAVA_HOME`, `$JAVA_OPTS`, `$CATALINA_BASE`, and
`$CONTENT_ROOT`

==== Tomcat on Windows

If you’re running Tomcat on an instance of Windows OS, you will want to
create a `setenv.bat` file.

We are going to create a file called `setenv.sh` in the Tomcat `bin/`
directory to:

* allow Tomcat to reference/find the location of `$JAVA_HOME` and
`$CATALINA_BASE`) during startup and shutdown;
* increase the amount of memory allocated to the JVM to enhance
performance by setting `$JAVA_OPTS`; and
* add additional settings to the JVM via `$JAVA_OPTS` to enable more
advanced services we will be learning about later on in this workshop.

Create the `setenv.sh` file.

Using your favorite text editor (gedit, vi, emacs, etc.), create a new
file called `setenv.sh` in the Tomcat `bin/` directory:

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------
$ pwd
/usr/local/tds/apache-tomcat-8.0.24

$ cd bin
$ vi setenv.sh
-----------------------------------

Add the following information and save your `setenv.sh` file:

[source,bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
#
# ENVARS for Tomcat
#
export CATALINA_HOME="/usr/local/tomcat"

export CATALINA_BASE="/usr/local/tomcat"

export JAVA_HOME="/usr"

# TDS specific ENVARS
#
# Define where the TDS content directory will live
#   THIS IS CRITICAL and there is NO DEFAULT - the
#   TDS will not start without this.
#
CONTENT_ROOT=-Dtds.content.root.path=/usr/local/tomcat/content

# set java prefs related variables (used by the wms service, for example)
JAVA_PREFS_ROOTS="-Djava.util.prefs.systemRoot=$CATALINA_HOME/content/thredds/javaUtilPrefs \
                  -Djava.util.prefs.userRoot=$CATALINA_HOME/content/thredds/javaUtilPrefs"

#
# Some commonly used JAVA_OPTS settings:
#
NORMAL="-d64 -Xmx4096m -Xms512m -server -ea"
HEAP_DUMP="-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError"
HEADLESS="-Djava.awt.headless=true"

#
# Standard setup.
#
JAVA_OPTS="$CONTENT_ROOT $NORMAL $MAX_PERM_GEN $HEAP_DUMP $HEADLESS $JAVA_PREFS_ROOTS"

export JAVA_OPTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Settings

Whenever possible, Unidata recommends `-Xmx4096m` (or more) for 64-bit
systems.

The parameters we pass to `$JAVA_OPTS`:

* `-Xms` is the initial and minimum allocated memory of the JVM (for
performance).
* `-Xmx` the maximum allocated memory of the JVM (for performance).
* `-server` tells the Hostspot compiler to run the JVM in ``server''
mode (for performance).
* `-Djava.awt.headless=true` is needed to prevent graphics rendering
code from assuming a graphics console exists. Without this, WMS code
will crash the server in some circumstances.
* `-Djava.util.prefs.systemRoot=$CATALINA_BASE/content/thredds/javaUtilPrefs`
allows the
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/faq.html#javaUtilPrefs[java.util.prefs]
of the TDS WMS to write system preferences to a location that is
writable by the Tomcat user.

Implement your changes by restarting Tomcat.

Restart Tomcat and examine the output generated to the terminal window
by the startup script:
[source,bash]
------
$ ./startup.sh
Using CATALINA_BASE:   /usr/local/tds/apache-tomcat-8.0.24
Using CATALINA_HOME:   /usr/local/tds/apache-tomcat-8.0.24
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /usr/local/tds/apache-tomcat-8.0.24/temp
Using JRE_HOME: /usr/local/tds/jdk1.8u51
Using CLASSPATH:       /usr/local/tds/apache-tomcat-8.0.24/bin/bootstrap.jar:/usr/local/tds/apache-tomcat-8.0.24/bin/tomcat-juli.jar
------
Did you notice any difference in the what is being reported to `STDOUT`
during startup?

Take a look at the running Tomcat process to see the new `$JAVA_OPTS`
settings:

[source,bash]
------
$ ps -ef | grep tomcat
tds      22007     1  9 09:44 pts/1    00:00:02 /usr/local/tds/jdk1.8u51/bin/java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/usr/local/tds/apache-tomcat-8.0.24/conf/logging.properties -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager -Xmx4096m

tds      22030 21675  0 09:44 pts/1    00:00:00 grep tomcat
------

==== Environment Variables

For more information on the environment variable prerequisites used by
Tomcat, consult `${tomcat_home}/bin/catalina.sh` (or `catalina.bat`)
file.

What allows us to create the `setenv.sh` file and have its contents
read? (Hint: have a look at the `catalina.sh` file in the Tomcat `bin/`
directory at lines 24 and 133).

==== Troubleshooting

* Do not forget include the ’`m`’ in your `-Xms` and `-Xmx` settings.
* You may have allocated too much memory for the JVM settings if Tomcat
fails to start and you get the following error reported in the Tomcat
log `catalina.out`:
* Likewise, if there is an error with your JVM memory allocation syntax
in the `setenv.sh` file, it will be reported to `catalina.out`:
* If you intend to use WMS and see something like the following in
reported in `catalina.out`:

[[logs]]
== Tomcat Log Files

=== Tomcat `logs/`

1.  Look at the different types of log files being generated in the
Tomcat `logs/` directory.
2.  Examining `catalina.out`.

=== Things to know about `catalina.out`

==== `catalina.out`

The
http://marc.info/?l=tomcat-user&w=2&r=1&s=catalina.out+rotate&q=b[Tomcat
Users mailing list] has seen a lot of traffic dedicated to
`catalina.out` logging and rotation.

* Tomcat `System.out` and `System.err` gets appended to `catalina.out`.
* `catalina.out` can quickly grow large if the hosted web applications
are not specifically catching and logging `System.out` and `System.err`
to designated files.
* `catalina.out` is not automatically rotated in Tomcat.
* You should employ an outside log rotation program (e.g., `logadm` or
`logrotate`) to rotate `catalina.out`.
* It is good practice to archive and remove old `catalina.out` files and
other log files out of the Tomcat `logs/` on a regular basis.
* On Windows, the `catalina.out` file is not automatically created.
Instead only the `catalina.yyyy-mm-dd.log` files are used. These have
equivalent content.

[[files]]
== Tomcat (Server-Level) Configuration Files

=== About `server.xml`

==== Keep in mind

Tomcat’s configuration files, including `server.xml` can be found in in
the Tomcat `conf/` directory.

* XML file (well-formed syntax is important).
* Tomcat’s main configuration file.
* Changes to `server.xml` do not take effect until Tomcat is restarted.
* Where we make changes to enhance TDS security.

=== Important elements in `server.xml`

1.  Examine the Elements in `server.xml`.

=== About `tomcat-users.xml`

* XML file (well-formed syntax is important).
* Stores user names, passwords and roles.
* Changes to `tomcat-users.xml` do not take effect until Tomcat is
restarted.
* What the TDS uses for user authentication and access control.

=== Important elements in `tomcat-users.xml`

1.  Examine the Elements in `tomcat-users.xml`.

[[deploying]]
== Deploying the TDS

=== About WAR files

* WAR is short for **W**eb **AR**chive.
* By default, Tomcat will automatically unpack the WAR distribution into
directory of the same name upon deployment.
* Note: the unpacked directory is overwritten each time a new WAR file
is deployed.

=== Downloading & deploying `thredds.war`

==== Upgrading the TDS

A <<Checklist#,maintenance checklist>> and contains helpful
information about upgrading the TDS.
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/UpgradingTo4.6.html[New
features] and
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/UpgradingTo4.6.html[configuration
changes] made between TDS versions are listed for each release.

ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/thredds/4.6/current/thredds.war[Download]
the TDS WAR file from Unidata’s web site.

We will be using the current _TDS 4.6.2 version_ for this workshop:

`thredds.war`

Deploy the TDS in Tomcat.

Put `thredds.war` in the Tomcat `webapps/` directory:

[source,bash]
-------------------------------------------------------------
$ pwd
/usr/local/tds/apache-tomcat-8.0.24/bin
$ cd ../webapps

$ mv ~/thredds.war .
$ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x 13 tds workshop     4096 Jul 15 09:37 docs

-rw-r--r--  1 tds workshop 33218655 Jul 15 09:50 thredds.war
-------------------------------------------------------------

Confirm the TDS has been deployed.

If Tomcat is already running, wait a couple of seconds after placing the
WAR file in the Tomcat `webapps/` and then verify the `thredds.war` file
was unpacked:

[source,bash]
-------------------------------------------------------------
$ ls -l

-rw-r--r--  1 tds workshop 33218655 Jul 15 09:50 thredds.war
-------------------------------------------------------------

Go to http://localhost:8080/thredds/ in your browser to verify the TDS
has been deployed:

image:images/tds.png[THREDDS Distribution Catalog]

Confirm the creation of the TDS `content/` directory.

Move into `${tomcat_home}` and do a long listing:
[source,bash]
----------------------------------------------------------
$ pwd
/usr/local/tds/apache-tomcat-8.0.24/webapps
$ cd ..
$ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x 2 tds workshop  4096 Jul 15 09:51 bin

----------------------------------------------------------

==== Troubleshooting

* Any error in the TDS deployment will be reported in the `catalina.out`
file of the Tomcat `logs/` directory.
* Be sure you have downloaded and deployed the correct version of the
TDS (version 4.3.18 snapshot for this workshop). The TDS version number
will appear in the blue bar at the bottom of TDS catalog pages.

[[manager]]
== Tomcat `manager` Application

=== About the `manager` application

==== More about `manager`

For more information about the Tomcat `manager` application, see the
Tomcat
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/manager-howto.html[Manager App
HOW-TO] documentation.

* ``Free'' web application that comes with Tomcat distribution.
* Lives in the `manager` directory in the Tomcat `webapps/` directory.
* Allows Tomcat administrators to deploy, undeploy, or reload web
applications such as the TDS without having to shut down and restart
Tomcat.
* Provides server status statistics for the JVM and each connector you
have configured in `server.xml`.

=== Accessing the Tomcat `manager` application

==== Changes to the `manager` application

The `manager` application URLs and roles has been re-structured. See the
Tomcat http://tomcat.apache.org/migration.html[Migration guide] for more
information.

Attempt to access the Tomcat `manager` application in your browser:
http://localhost:8080/manager/html/. You will be prompted to login via
BASIC authentication, which will end in failure since we do not yet have
permission to access the `manager` application:

image:images/manager401.png[Manager app with 401 response code]

Based on what we know about Tomcat configuration, which file in the
Tomcat `conf/` directory should we edit to grant ourselves access to the
`manager` application?

==== Keep in mind

Changes to `tomcat-users.xml` do not take effect until Tomcat is
restarted.

=== Granting access to the `manager` application

Modify `tomcat-users.xml` to add `role` and `user` elements.

Using your favorite editor, open `${tomcat_home}/conf/tomcat-users.xml`:

[source,bash]
---------------------
$ vi tomcat-users.xml
---------------------

Between the `<tomcat-users>` tags, add a `role` element and specify the
`rolename` attribute as `manager`:

[source,xml]
----------------------------------
<tomcat-users>
    <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
</tomcat-users>
----------------------------------

Now add a new user by adding a `user` element. Create a `username` and
`password` for the new user and specify `manager-gui` as one of the
`roles` (in this example we are creating a user called `admin' with a
corresponding password of `secret'):

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<tomcat-users>
    <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
    <user username="admin" password="secret" roles="manager-gui"/>
</tomcat-users>
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Restart Tomcat and log into the `manager` application.

==== Thinking ahead

To gain access to restricted parts of the TDS, you will perform the same
steps you used to grant yourself access to the `manager` application.

Attempt to access the `manager` application again
(http://localhost:8080/manager/html/), this time logging in using the
`name` and `password` specified in `tomcat-users.xml`:

image:images/manager.png[Tomcat manager application]

Voilà! You should have access to the `manager` application.

==== Troubleshooting

* Check the XML syntax in `tomcat-users.xml` to make sure it is
well-formed and without error.
* Did you restart Tomcat after you made your changes to
`tomcat-users.xml`?
* Any errors will be reported in the Tomcat `logs/catalina.out` file.

=== Deploying the TDS using the `manager` application

1.  Use the `manager` application to undeploy the TDS.
2.  Deploy the TDS using the `manager` application.

[[next]]
== Next Steps: Where To Go From Here

=== You’re not finished yet

==== TDS Monitoring & Debugging Tools

You will need to enable <<Security#ssl,Enable SSL encryption>> to
access a couple of TDS monitoring and debugging tools.

* If you plan to deploy the TDS in a _production environment_ you will
need to follow the best practices outlined in the
<<Security#,Production server overview>> section of the tutorial
to finish hardening your server environment.
* The <<BasicThreddsConfig_xml#,Basic TDS Configuration>> and
<<ConfigCatalogs#,TDS Configuration Catalogs>> sections of this
tutorial covers the TDS configuration files, configuration options and
TDS catalog structure.
