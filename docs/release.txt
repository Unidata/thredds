========================================
Building with gradle (4.4+)

1. checkout from git

2. configure gradle

add a file gradle.properties to $userHome/.gradle  directory, with these properties:

  keystore=/share/idv/.keystore-2012
  keystoreAlias=<alias>
  keystorePassword=<password>
  webdir=W:/content/software/netcdf-java/v4.3/
  ftpdir=V:/pub/netcdf-java/v4.3

where:

 first 3 are for signing jars
 next 2 are locations for releasing cdm jars
 (the values can all be fake until you get to step 4, but keys must be defined)

3. build from command line. this will download current gradle, skipping tests:

    gradlew clean build -x test

   to run tests:

    gradlew test --continue

4. build from intellij (problems with 12.1, apparently will be improved in v13)

4.1 upgrade intellij Project

  File > Settings
  Gradle

  - enter $thredds/build.gradle into box
  - accept all the defaults

  A JetGradle left side tab will now appear

4.2 new intellij project

  1) File > Import Project

    - navigate entry box to $thredds/build.gradle
    - accept all the defaults
    - a .idea directory is added under $thredds

  2) add git root to project

     File > Settings
     Version Control - add $thredds to git root


--------------------------

1) install gradle

Download latest gradle from gradle.org. Currently at 1.7-rc-2
Unzip into your chosen directory.
Add env variable GRADLE_HOME = gradle top directory
Add GRADLE_HOME/bin directory to your path
test from command line: "gradle -version"

2) configure gradle

add a file gradle.properties to $userHome/.gradle  directory, with these properties:

  keystore=/share/idv/.keystore-2012
  keystoreAlias=<alias>
  keystorePassword=<password>
  webdir=W:/content/software/netcdf-java/v4.3/
  ftpdir=V:/pub/netcdf-java/v4.3

where:

first 3 are for signing jars
next 2 are locations for releasing cdm jars
(the values can all be fake until you get to step 4, but keys must be defined)

3) building

cd $THREDDS
gradle clean install -x test

first time, you will see gradle pull down maven artifacts into its repository in $userHome/.gradle/cache

3) release


========================================
Making a release for CDM/TDS with jenkins
12/18/2012
edited 8/1/2013

1. Jenkins
  - Go to CDM/TDS project's configuration page
      - Click on the 3rd "advanced" button from the top
      - For the "Checkout/merge to local branch (optional)" option, give the branch name for the next version, eg "target-{next}"
      - "Save" the changes
  - Click on "Perform maven release"
      - Click on "Schedule Maven Release Build"
  - Build is done
      - Check logs for success (or any problems)
      - If the local branch is not specified, you will get the following error
        "Detecting the current branch failed: fatal: ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref"

2. Check that all went well:
    - gitHub has new release tag, eg "v{release}"
    - gitHub has new branch, eg "target-{next}"
    - Check release artifacts are in artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu, eg http://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/tds/{release}/

3. Jenkins
   -  Go back to the CMD/TDS project's configuration page
    - Update "Branches to build" to new branch, eg "target-{next}"
    - Clear "Checkout/merge to local branch (optional)" value
    - Save

4. Git
  - checkout new release tag, eg "v{release}" created by Jenkins/Maven build (NOT target-{release})
      git fetch origin
      git checkout v{release}
  - this branch will have version {release}, not {release}-SNAPSHOT in the maven poms
  - create a temporary local branch (temp15) based on new release tag, "v{release}"
      git checkout -b temp15
  - push temporary branch to unidata/master
      git push origin temp15:master (seemed to work, even though intellij says "push rejected ??)
  - switch to master branch
      git fetch origin
      git checkout master
  - clean up (delete) any old branches
    git branch -d temp15

5. put thredds.war on conan ftp
  - cd /web/ftp/pub/thredds/4.3
  - mkdir {release}
  - from http://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/tds/{release}/
     download tds-{release}.war tds-{release}.war.md5 tds-{release}.sha1 to /web/ftp/pub/thredds/4.3/{release}
     rename to thredds.war, thredds.war.md5 and thredds.war.sha1
  - move /web/ftp/pub/thredds/4.3/current to point to /web/ftp/pub/thredds/4.3/{release}
     rm current
     ln -s {release} current

6. put tdm.jar, netcdfAll.jar onto conan ftp
  - build it
    cd {github/thredds}
    mvn clean install
    cp {github/thredds}/tdm/build/tdm-{release}.jar /web/ftp/pub/thredds/4.3/current/tdm-4.3.jar
    cp {github/thredds}/ui/target/netcdfAll-{release}.jar to /web/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/v4.3

7. CDM has additional targets that are handled by gradle builds
  - make sure you have correct gradle.properties in ~home/.gradle/
  - cd {github/thredds}
  1. make supporting libraries
      gradle clean build -x test
  2. release cdm javadocs to conan:/content/software/netcdf-java/v4.3/javadoc
      gradle -p cdm releaseDocs
  3. release all javadocs to conan:/content/software/netcdf-java/v4.3/javadocAll
      gradle -p ui releaseDocs
  4. release webstart to conan:/content/software/netcdf-java/v4.3/webstart
     release ToolsUI.jar to conan:/pub/netcdf-java/v4.3/
      gradle -p ui releaseCdm
  5. release ncIdv.jar to conan:/pub/netcdf-java/v4.3/
      gradle -p ncIdv releaseCdm
  6. (kludge)
      mvn clean install
      copy ui/target/netcdfAll-{release}.jar to /web/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/v4.3

8. update links on conan
  - in /web/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/v4.3:
     rm toolsUI-4.3.jar netcdfAll-4.3.jar ncIdv-4.3.jar
     ln -s toolsUI-{release}.jar toolsUI-4.3.jar
     ln -s netcdfAll-{release}.jar netcdfAll-4.3.jar
     ln -s ncIdv-4.3.14.jar ncIdv-4.3.jar

9. update Unidata download page(s)
  - check http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/thredds/index.jsp
    modify conan:/content/downloads/thredds/toc.xml as needed
  - check http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/netcdf-java-4/index.jsp
    modify conan:/content/downloads/netcdf/netcdf-java-4/toc.xml as needed

10. if you need to do any changes to web pages, do it on the next branch (eg target-{next})
