Making a release for CDM/TDS with jenkins

1. Jenkins
  - Go to CDM/TDS project's configuration page
      - Click on the 3rd "advanced" button from the top
      - For the "Checkout/merge to local branch (optional)" option, give the branch name for the next version, eg "target-{next}"
      - "Save" the changes
  - Click on "Perform maven release"
      - Click on "Schedule Maven Release Build"
  - Build is done
      - Check logs for success (or any problems)
      - If the local branch is not specified, you will get the following error
        "Detecting the current branch failed: fatal: ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref"

2. Check that all went well:
    - gitHub has new release tag, eg "v{release}"
    - gitHub has new branch, eg "target-{next}"
    - Check release artifacts are in artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu, eg http://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/tds/{release}/

3. Jenkins
   -  Go back to the CMD/TDS project's configuration page
    - Update "Branches to build" to new branch, eg "target-{next}"
    - Clear "Checkout/merge to local branch (optional)" value
    - Save

4. Git
  - checkout new release tag, eg "v{release}" created by Jenkins/Maven build (NOT target-{release})
      git fetch origin
      git checkout v{release}
  - this branch will have version {release}, not {release}-SNAPSHOT in the maven poms
  - create a temporary local branch (temp15) based on new release tag, "v{release}"
      git checkout -b temp15
  - push temporary branch to unidata/master
      git push origin temp15:master (seemed to work, even though intellij says "push rejected ??)
  - switch to master branch
      git fetch origin
      git checkout master
  - clean up (delete) any old branches
    git branch -d temp15

5. put thredds.war on conan ftp
  - cd /web/ftp/pub/thredds/4.3
  - mkdir {release}
  - from http://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/tds/{release}/
     download tds-{release}.war tds-{release}.war.md5 tds-{release}.sha1 to /web/ftp/pub/thredds/4.3/{release}
     rename to thredds.war, thredds.war.md5 and thredds.war.sha1
  - move /web/ftp/pub/thredds/4.3/current to point to /web/ftp/pub/thredds/4.3/{release}
     rm current
     ln -s {release} current

6. put tdm.jar, netcdfAll.jar onto conan ftp
  - build it
    cd {github/thredds}
    mvn clean install
    cp {github/thredds}/tdm/build/tdm-{release}.jar /web/ftp/pub/thredds/4.3/current/tdm-4.3.jar
    cp {github/thredds}/ui/target/netcdfAll-{release}.jar to /web/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/v4.3

7. CDM has additional targets that are handled by gradle builds
  - make sure you have correct gradle.properties in ~home/.gradle/
  - cd {github/thredds}
  1. make supporting libraries
      gradle clean build -x test
  2. release cdm javadocs to conan:/content/software/netcdf-java/v4.3/javadoc
      gradle -p cdm releaseDocs
  3. release all javadocs to conan:/content/software/netcdf-java/v4.3/javadocAll
      gradle -p ui releaseDocs
  4. release webstart to conan:/content/software/netcdf-java/v4.3/webstart
     release ToolsUI.jar to conan:/pub/netcdf-java/v4.3/
      gradle -p ui releaseCdm
  5. release ncIdv.jar to conan:/pub/netcdf-java/v4.3/
      gradle -p ncIdv releaseCdm
  6. (kludge)
      mvn clean install
      copy ui/target/netcdfAll-{release}.jar to /web/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/v4.3

8. update links on conan
  - in /web/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/v4.3:
     rm toolsUI-4.3.jar netcdfAll-4.3.jar ncIdv-4.3.jar
     ln -s toolsUI-{release}.jar toolsUI-4.3.jar
     ln -s netcdfAll-{release}.jar netcdfAll-4.3.jar
     ln -s ncIdv-4.3.14.jar ncIdv-4.3.jar

9. update Unidata download page(s)
  - check http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/thredds/index.jsp
    modify conan:/content/downloads/thredds/toc.xml as needed
  - check http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/netcdf-java-4/index.jsp
    modify conan:/content/downloads/netcdf/netcdf-java-4/toc.xml as needed

10. if you need to do any changes to web pages, do it on the next branch (eg target-{next})
