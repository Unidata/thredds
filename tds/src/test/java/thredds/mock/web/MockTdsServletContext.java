A common setup is to point your JVM working directory to the root of your web application directory, in combination with filesystem-based
resource loading. This allows to load the context files as used in the web application, with relative paths getting interpreted correctly.
Such a setup will work with both FileSystemXmlApplicationContext (which will load straight from the filesystem) and XmlWebApplicationContext
with an underlying MockServletContext (as long as the MockServletContext has been configured with a FileSystemResourceLoader).
