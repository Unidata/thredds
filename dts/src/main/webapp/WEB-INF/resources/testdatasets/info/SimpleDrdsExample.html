<h2>SimpleDrdsExample Dataset Additional Information File</h2>
<h3>
    <p>
        This is an example of a Dataset Additional Information File (DAIF). You can use it
        to provide additional information about your data sets. This can include any type
        of image or link you might choose to include (for example, you might have an exisiting
        web site that discusses your data and/or your research program). If you are reading this
        with a browser you are most likely getting the document from the OPeNDAP servlet, which
        means that most of the content is dynamically generated, thus viewing the source for
        this page may mislead you as to which part of the content is coming from the DAIF.
