<h2>DODS Test Server</h2>

<p>
    This data is being served by the Java-DODS Test Server. This server was created to allow <i>any</i> possible DODS
    data structure to be tested for viablity in both the client and server software components of DODS.
</p>

<p>
    This server will take any DODS DDS and attempt serve it to clients with all implemented modes of functionality. It
    will populate it with data (created from thin air!) and hand it back to a requesting client. It can also be
    intergogated using the other DODS server interfaces such as the ASCII interface (.asc) the DDS (.dds) interface, the
    DAS interface (.das), and the HTML interface (.html, also know as the interface from hell...)
</p>

<p>
    The key word in the preceding paragraph is <i>attempt</i>. Since the DODS dataset specification allows for a
    virtually unlimited range of dataset structures, it certainly possible to create datasets that break existing code,
    either on the client or the server side. We have, to the best of our abilities, made the DODS core software capable
    of handling all possible syntactically correct DODS datasets as described by a DDS. However, it is possible to
    construct dataset definitions (DDS's) so weird and twisted that the DODS core software cannot handle them well.
    Ultimately that's why this server exists: <h3><i>To explore the boundaries of what DODS can and cannot do.</i></h3>

    Hopefully, you will find it useful too.
