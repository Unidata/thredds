# Only do so for the "build" task, as that is where the artifacts are actually created.
#
# Also, only do so if the ARTIFACTS_KEY variable is set. It--along with ARTIFACTS_SECRET and ARTIFACTS_BUCKET--must be
# defined in order for Travis to be able to upload artifacts. Because they contain sensitive information, we've defined
# those values in the Travis repository settings of the Unidata/thredds repo.
# See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/uploading-artifacts/
# See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings
#
# A consequence of defining those variables in the Travis repositories settings is that they are only
# available to builds of branches on the Unidata/thredds GitHub repo. They are NOT available to forks, such as
# cwardgar/thredds. This was a deliberate design decision made by the Travis devs to protect sensitive data.
# But for us, it means that artifacts won't be uploaded for pull requests against our personal thredds forks.
#
# An alternative mechanism for protecting sensitive information is encrypted variables. But once again, those
# variables are not made available to untrusted builds such as pull requests coming from another repository.
# See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Encrypted-Variables
