/**
 * The goal of this class is to allow
 * other classes to access the data stream
 * associated with a method response.
 * It tracks the method and the session
 * to allow them to be closed
 * when the stream hits eof.
 * It also guarantees that any remaining unconsumed
 * input is consumed.
 *
 * Note that this class is not public in the package.
 *
 * Note that this code now includes the equivalent of
 * Tom Kunicki's proposed pull request, but with the HTTPMethod
 * close extension he proposes but does not implement.
